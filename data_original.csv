Rachel Adedeji,"In 2015, Adedeji married Jason Finnegan; she announced she was pregnant with the pair's first child in 2017, taking maternity leave from Hollyoaks. In 2020, Adedeji took to social media to open up about racism she has encountered while working on the programme. She stated she was told ""You're all the same"" by a make-up artist, and said that black actresses on Hollyoaks were ""forced to drastically change their hair"" after being told viewers wouldn't be able to tell them apart, and that in her four years on the soap, she had only worked with one black director. She added: ""Working at Hollyoaks is mostly positive, but the experiences I have encountered are a constant reminder of how difficult it is being a black woman in the industry. I am no longer standing for it."" A few days later, the soap launched an investigation into her claims, with producers stating that they were ""deeply shocked and saddened"" by the issues that she had addressed. The investigation included a multi-step action plan to root out any further instances of racism.","Adedeji began her career as a singer, beginning singing at the age of eight, later studying musical theater in college. She performed in many musical productions and had a role in the musical Mamma Mia!. In 2008, Adedeji entered the fifth series of The X Factor, where she made it to bootcamp.

Adele,"Adele began dating charity entrepreneur Simon Konecki in mid-2011. Their son Angelo James was born on 19 October 2012. On the topic of becoming a parent, Adele said she ""felt like I was truly living. I had a purpose, where before I didn't"". Adele and Konecki brought a privacy case against a UK-based photo agency that published intrusive paparazzi images of their son taken during family outings in 2013. Lawyers working on their behalf accepted damages from the company in July 2014. Adele has also opened up about suffering from postnatal depression, anxiety, and panic attacks.

In early 2017, tabloids started speculating that Adele and Konecki had secretly married when they were spotted wearing matching rings on their ring fingers. During her acceptance speech at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards for Album of the Year, Adele seemed to have confirmed these reports by referring to Konecki as ""my husband"" when thanking him. She repeated this in March 2017, telling the audience at a concert in Brisbane, Australia, ""I'm married now"". However, in a 2021 interview with British Vogue, she revealed that they actually married in 2018, and separated the same year. During this time, Adele became a stay-at-home mother. In April 2019, Adele's representatives confirmed the separation via Associated Press, and affirmed that she and Konecki would continue to raise their son together. On 13 September 2019, it was reported that Adele had filed for divorce from Konecki in the US. Their divorce was finalised on 4 March 2021. In 2021, Adele entered a relationship with American sports agent Rich Paul.

Politically, she is a supporter of the Labour Party, saying in 2011 that she was a ""Labour girl through and through"", and in the same interview was critical of the Conservative Party. Despite this declared political alignment, Adele received backlash for her comments on paying taxes during a 2011 interview with Q magazine. She said, ""I use the NHS, I can't use public transport any more, doing what I do, I went to state school, I'm mortified to have to pay 50 percent! Trains are always late, most state schools are shit and I've gotta give you like four million quid, are you having a laugh? When I got my tax bill in from 19 I was ready to go and buy a gun and randomly open fire.""

Born in the North London district of Tottenham, Adele supports local football club Tottenham Hotspur. In 2017, Adele was ranked the richest musician under age 30 in the UK and Ireland on the Sunday Times Rich List, which valued her wealth at £125 million. She was ranked the 19th richest musician overall. On the 2019 list, she was valued at £150 million as the 22nd richest musician in the UK.

In 2015, Adele said, ""I'm a feminist, I believe that everyone should be treated the same, including race and sexuality"".

Supportive of the LGBT community, on 12 June 2016, an emotional Adele dedicated her show in Antwerp, Belgium, to the victims of the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, United States, earlier that day, adding, ""The LGBTQ community, they're like my soul mates since I was really young, so I'm very moved by it.""

In April 2018, it was widely reported that Adele had become an ordained minister in order to officiate at close friend comedian Alan Carr's wedding to Paul Drayton, something which Adele herself subsequently confirmed. The wedding, held in January 2018, took place in the garden of her house in Los Angeles, California.","

Four months after graduation, Adele published two songs on the fourth issue of the online arts publication PlatformsMagazine.com. She had recorded a three-song demo for a class project and given it to a friend. The friend posted the demo on Myspace, where it became very successful and led to a phone call from Richard Russell, boss of the music label XL Recordings. She doubted if the offer was real because the only record company she knew was Virgin Records, and she took a friend with her to the meeting.

Nick Huggett, at XL, recommended Adele to manager Jonathan Dickins at September Management, and in June 2006, Dickins became her official representative. September was managing Jamie T at the time and this proved a major draw for Adele, a big fan of the British singer-songwriter. Huggett then signed Adele to XL in September 2006. Adele provided vocals for Jack Peñate's song, ""My Yvonne,"" for his debut album, and it was during this session she first met producer Jim Abbiss, who would go on to produce both the majority of her debut album, 19, and tracks on 21. In June 2007, Adele made her television debut, performing ""Daydreamer"" on the BBC's Later... with Jools Holland. Adele's breakthrough song, ""Hometown Glory"", written when she was 16, was released in October 2007.

By 2008, Adele had become the headliner and performed an acoustic set, in which she was supported by Damien Rice. She became the first recipient of the Brit Awards Critics' Choice and was named the number-one predicted breakthrough act of 2008 in an annual BBC poll of music critics, Sound of 2008. She released her second single, ""Chasing Pavements"", on 14 January 2008, two weeks ahead of her debut album. The song reached number two on the UK Chart, and stayed there for four weeks. The album 19, named for her age at the time she wrote and composed many of its songs, entered the British charts at number one. The Times Encyclopedia of Modern Music named 19 an ""essential"" blue-eyed soul recording. Adele was nominated for a 2008 Mercury Prize award for 19. She also won an Urban Music Award for ""Best Jazz Act,"" and a Music of Black Origin (MOBO) nomination in the category of Best UK Female. In March 2008, Adele signed a deal with Columbia Records and XL Recordings for her foray into the United States. She embarked on a short North American tour in the same month, and 19 was released in the US in June. Billboard magazine stated of it: ""Adele truly has potential to become among the most respected and inspiring international artists of her generation."" The An Evening with Adele world tour began in May 2008 and ended in June 2009.

She later cancelled the 2008 US tour dates to be with a former boyfriend. She said in Nylon magazine in June 2009, ""I'm like, 'I can't believe I did that.' It seems so ungrateful.... I was drinking far too much and that was kind of the basis of my relationship with this boy. I couldn't bear to be without him, so I was like, 'Well, I'll just cancel my stuff then.'"" She referred to this period as her ""early life crisis"". She is also known for her dislike of flying and bouts of homesickness when away from her native London. By the middle of October 2008, Adele's attempt to break in America appeared to have failed. But then she was booked as the musical guest on 18 October 2008 episode of NBC's Saturday Night Live. The episode, which included an expected appearance by then US vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, earned the program its best ratings in 14 years with 17 million viewers. Adele performed ""Chasing Pavements"" and ""Cold Shoulder,"" and the following day, 19 topped the iTunes charts and ranked at number five at Amazon.com while ""Chasing Pavements"" rose into the top 25. The album reached number 11 on the Billboard 200 as a result, a jump of 35 places over the previous week. In November 2008, Adele moved to Notting Hill, London after leaving her mother's house, a move that prompted her to give up drinking. The album was certified gold in early 2009, by the RIAA. By July 2009, the album had sold 2.2 million copies worldwide.

At the 51st Annual Grammy Awards in February 2009, Adele won the award for Best New Artist, in addition to the award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for ""Chasing Pavements"", which was also nominated for Record of the Year and Song of the Year. Adele performed ""Chasing Pavements"" at the ceremony in a duet with Jennifer Nettles. In 2010, Adele received a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for ""Hometown Glory."" In April her song ""My Same"" entered the German Singles Chart after it had been performed by Lena Meyer-Landrut in the talent show contest Unser Star für Oslo, or Our Star for Oslo, in which the German entry to the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 was determined. In late September, after being featured on The X Factor, Adele's version of Bob Dylan's ""Make You Feel My Love"" re-entered the UK singles chart at number 4. During the 2010 CMT Artists of the Year special, Adele performed a widely publicised duet of Lady Antebellum's ""Need You Now"" with Darius Rucker. This performance was later nominated for a CMT Music Award.

Adele released her second studio album, 21, on 24 January 2011 in the UK and 22 February in the US. She said the album was inspired by the breakup with her former partner. The album's sound is described as classic and contemporary country and roots music. The change in sound from her debut album was the result of her bus driver playing contemporary music from Nashville when she was touring the American South, and the title reflected the growth she had experienced in the prior two years. Adele told Spin Magazine: ""It was really exciting for me because I never grew up around [that music]."" 21 topped the charts in 30 countries, including the UK and the US.

An emotional performance of ""Someone Like You"" at the 31st Brit Awards on 15 February propelled the song to number one in the UK. Her first album, 19, re-entered the UK album chart alongside 21, while first and second singles ""Rolling in the Deep"" and ""Someone Like You"" were in the top 5 of the UK singles chart, making Adele the first living artist to achieve the feat of two top-five hits in both the Official Singles Chart and the Official Albums Chart simultaneously since the Beatles in 1964. Both songs topped the charts in multiple markets and broke numerous sales performance records. Following her performance of ""Someone Like You"" at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, it became Adele's second number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. By December 2011, 21 sold over 3.4 million copies in the UK, and became the biggest-selling album of the 21st century, overtaking Amy Winehouse's Back to Black, with Adele becoming the first artist ever to sell three million albums in the UK in one calendar year. ""Set Fire to the Rain"" became Adele's third number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100, as Adele became the first artist ever to have an album, 21, hold the number-one position on the Billboard 200 concurrently with three number-one singles. Moreover, 21 had the most weeks on the Billboard 200 chart of any album by a female artist.

To promote the album, Adele embarked upon the ""Adele Live"" tour, which sold out its North American leg. In October 2011, Adele was forced to cancel two tours because of a vocal-cord haemorrhage. She released a statement saying she needed an extended period of rest to avoid permanent damage to her voice. In the first week of November 2011 Steven M. Zeitels, director of the Center for Laryngeal Surgery and Voice Rehabilitation at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, performed laser microsurgery on Adele's vocal cords to remove a benign polyp. A recording of her tour, Live at the Royal Albert Hall, was released in November 2011, debuting at number one in the US with 96,000 copies sold, the highest one-week tally for a music DVD in four years, becoming the best-selling music DVD of 2011. Adele is the first artist in Nielsen SoundScan history to have the year's number-one album (21), number-one single (""Rolling in the Deep""), and number-one music video (Live at the Royal Albert Hall). At the 2011 American Music Awards on 20 November, Adele won three awards; Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist, Favorite Adult Contemporary Artist, and Favorite Pop/Rock Album for 21. On 9 December, Billboard named Adele Artist of the Year, Billboard 200 Album of the Year (21), and the Billboard Hot 100 Song of the Year (""Rolling in the Deep""), becoming the first woman ever to top all three categories.

Following the throat microsurgery, she made her live comeback at the 2012 Grammy Awards in February. She won in all six categories for which she was nominated, including Album of the Year, Record of the Year, and Song of the Year, making her the second female artist in Grammy history, after Beyoncé, to win that many awards in a single night. Following that success, 21 achieved the biggest weekly sales increase following a Grammy win since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking data in 1991. Adele received the Brit Award for British Female Solo Artist, and British Album of the Year presented to her by George Michael. Following the Brit Awards, 21 reached number one for the 21st non-consecutive week in the UK. The album has sold over 4.5 million copies in the UK where it is the fourth-best-selling album. In October, the album's sales surpassed 4.5 million in the UK, and in November it surpassed 10 million sales in the US. The best-selling album worldwide of 2011 and 2012,, the album has sold over 31 million copies. By the end of 2014, she had sold an estimated 40 million albums and 50 million singles worldwide. Adele is the only artist or band in the last decade in the US to earn an RIAA diamond certification for a one disc album in less than two years.

In October 2012, Adele confirmed that she had been writing, composing and recording the theme song for Skyfall, the twenty-third James Bond film. The song ""Skyfall,"" written and composed in collaboration with producer Paul Epworth, was recorded at Abbey Road Studios, and features orchestrations by J. A. C. Redford. Adele stated recording ""Skyfall"" was ""one of the proudest moments of my life."" On 14 October, ""Skyfall"" rose to number 2 on the UK Singles Chart with sales of 92,000 copies bringing its overall sales to 176,000, and ""Skyfall"" entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 8, selling 261,000 copies in the US in its first three days. This tied ""Skyfall"" with Duran Duran's ""A View to a Kill"" as the highest-charting James Bond theme song on the UK Singles Chart; a record surpassed in 2015 by Sam Smith's ""Writing's on the Wall"".

""Skyfall"" has sold more than five million copies worldwide and earned Adele the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song and the Academy Award for Best Original Song. In December 2012, Adele was named Billboard Artist of the Year, and 21 was named Album of the Year, making her the first artist to receive both accolades two years in a row. Adele was also named top female artist. The Associated Press named Adele Entertainer of the Year for 2012. The 2013 Grammy Awards saw Adele's live version of ""Set Fire to the Rain"" win the Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance, bringing her total wins to nine.

On 3 April 2012, Adele confirmed that her third album would likely be at least two years away, stating, ""I have to take time and live a little bit. There were a good two years between my first and second albums, so it'll be the same this time."" She stated that she would continue writing and composing her own material. At the 2013 Grammy Awards, she confirmed that she was in the very early stages of her third album. She also stated that she will most likely work with Paul Epworth again.

In September 2013, Wiz Khalifa confirmed that he and Adele had collaborated on a song for his fifth studio album, Blacc Hollywood, though the collaboration did not make the final track listing. In January 2014, Adele received her tenth Grammy Award with ""Skyfall"" winning Best Song Written for Visual Media at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards.On the eve of her 26th birthday in May 2014, Adele posted a cryptic message via her Twitter account which prompted media discussion about her next album. The message, ""Bye bye 25... See you again later in the year,"" was interpreted by some in the media, including Capital FM, as meaning that her next album would be titled 25 and released later in the year. In 2014, Adele was nominated for nine World Music Awards. In early August, Paul Moss suggested that an album would be released in 2014 or 2015. However, in the October 2014 accounts filed with Companies House by XL Recordings, they ruled out a 2014 release. On 27 August 2015, Billboard reported that Adele's label, XL Recordings, had intentions of releasing her third studio album sometime in November 2015. Danger Mouse was revealed to have contributed a song, while Tobias Jesso Jr. had written a track, and Ryan Tedder was ""back in the mix after producing and co-writing 'Rumour Has It' on 21."" At the 72nd Venice International Film Festival in early September 2015, Sia announced that her new single ""Alive"" was co-written by Adele, and had originally been intended for Adele's third album. On 18 October, a 30-second clip of new material from Adele was shown on UK television during a commercial break on The X Factor. The commercial teases a snippet from a new song from her third album, with viewers hearing a voice singing accompanied by lyrics on a black screen.

In a statement released three days later, Adele confirmed the album's title to be 25, with her stating, ""My last record was a break-up record, and if I had to label this one, I would call it a make-up record. Making up for lost time. Making up for everything I ever did and never did. 25 is about getting to know who I've become without realising. And I'm sorry it took so long but, you know, life happened."" At the time, Adele said 25 would be her last album titled after her age, believing it would be the end to a trilogy. On 22 October, Adele confirmed that 25 would be released on 20 November, while the lead single from the album, ""Hello"" would be released on 23 October. The song was first played on Nick Grimshaw's Radio 1 Breakfast Show on the BBC on the morning of 23 October with Adele interviewed live. The video of ""Hello"", released on 22 October, was viewed over 27.7 million times on YouTube in its first 24 hours, breaking the Vevo record for the most views in a day, surpassing the 20.1 million views for ""Bad Blood"" by Taylor Swift. On 28 October, BBC News reported that ""Hello"" was being viewed on YouTube an average one million times an hour. ""Hello"" went on to become the fastest video to hit one billion views on YouTube, which it achieved after 88 days. The video for ""Hello"" captured iconic British elements such as a red telephone box and a cup of tea. The song debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart on 30 October, with first week sales of 330,000 copies, making it the biggest-selling number one single in three years. ""Hello"" also debuted at number one in many countries around the world, including Australia, France, Canada, New Zealand, Ireland and Germany, and on 2 November, the song debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the first song in the US to sell at least one million downloads in a week, setting the record at 1.11 million. By the end of 2015, it had sold 12.3 million units globally and was the year's 7th-best-selling single despite being released in late October.

On 27 October, BBC One announced plans for Adele at the BBC, a one-hour special presented by Graham Norton, in which Adele talks about her new album and performs new songs. This was her first television appearance since performing at the 2013 Academy Awards ceremony, and the show was recorded before a live audience on 2 November for broadcast on 20 November, coinciding with the release of 25. On 27 October it was also announced that Adele would appear on the US entertainment series Saturday Night Live on 21 November. On 30 October, Adele confirmed that she would be performing a one-night-only concert titled Adele Live in New York City at the Radio City Music Hall on 17 November. Subsequently, NBC aired the concert special on 14 December.

On 27 November, 25 debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and became the fastest selling album in UK chart history with over 800,000 copies sold in its first week. The album debuted at number one in the US where it sold a record-breaking 3.38 million copies in its first week, the largest single sales week for an album since Nielsen began monitoring sales in 1991. 25 also broke first week sales records in Canada and New Zealand. 25 became the best-selling album of 2015 in a number of countries, including Australia, the UK and the US, spending seven consecutive weeks at number one in each country, before being displaced by David Bowie's Blackstar. It was the best-selling album worldwide of 2015 with 17.4 million copies sold. 25 has since sold 20 million copies globally. Adele's seven weeks at the top of the UK Albums Chart took her total to 31 weeks at number one in the UK with her three albums, surpassing Madonna's previous record of most weeks at number one for a female act. As the best-selling artist worldwide for 2015 the IFPI named Adele the Global Recording Artist of the Year.

In November 2015, Adele's 2016 tour was announced, her first tour since 2011. Beginning in Europe, Adele Live 2016 included four dates at the Manchester Arena in March 2016, six dates at the O2 Arena, London, with further dates in Ireland, Spain, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands among others. Her North American Tour began on 5 July in St. Paul, Minnesota. The leg included six nights at Madison Square Garden in New York City, eight nights at Staples Center in Los Angeles, and four nights at Air Canada Centre in Toronto. Adele broke Taylor Swift's five-show record for most consecutive sold-out shows at the Staples Center.

At the 36th Brit Awards in London on 24 February, Adele received the awards for British Female Solo Artist, British Album of the Year for 25, British Single of the Year for ""Hello"", and British Global Success, bringing her Brit Award wins to eight. She closed the ceremony by performing ""When We Were Young"", the second single from 25. Two more singles from 25 were released in 2016: ""Send My Love (To Your New Lover)"" and ""Water Under the Bridge"". While on stage at London's O2 Arena on 17 March, Adele announced that she would be headlining on the Pyramid Stage at the 2016 Glastonbury Festival, which was later confirmed by the festival's organisers. She appeared for a 90-minute fifteen song set at the festival on 25 June in front of 150,000 people, and described the experience as ""by far, the best moment of my life so far"". In an interview with Jo Whiley on BBC Radio 2 around 30-minutes before going on stage, Adele had said she had been going to Glastonbury since she was a child and that the festival had meant a lot to her, before she broke down. Whiley recalls, ""She was really scared, really, really scared. We were doing the interview and at one point she had to stop as she was in tears. It was amazing to see somebody like that, then to witness her walking out on stage and doing the most incredible set. To know that half an hour before she'd been in tears at the thought of walking out there.""

As part of her world tour, in February and March 2017, Adele performed in Australia for the first time, playing outdoor stadiums around the country. Her first two shows in New Zealand sold out in a record-breaking 23 minutes, and a third show was announced, with all tickets sold in under 30 minutes. Adele sold over 600,000 tickets for her record-breaking eight date Australian tour, setting stadium records throughout the country; her Sydney show at ANZ Stadium on 10 March was seen by 95,000 people, the biggest single concert in Australian history, a record she broke the following night with more than 100,000 fans. Adele completed her world tour with two concerts, dubbed ""The Finale"", at Wembley Stadium, London on 28 and 29 June. She announced the shows at ""the home of football"" by singing the England football team's ""Three Lions"" anthem and also the theme song to the BBC's weekly Premier League football show Match of the Day. Adele had added another two concerts at Wembley after the first two dates sold out, however she cancelled the last two dates of the tour after damaging her vocal cords. As a show of support, fans instead gathered outside Wembley Stadium to perform renditions of her songs, in an event titled ""Sing for Adele"".

At the end of 2016, Billboard named Adele Artist of the Year for the third time, and also received the Top Billboard 200 album. 25 was the best-selling album for a second consecutive year in the US. With 235 million views, Adele's Carpool Karaoke through the streets of London with James Corden, a sketch which featured on Corden's talk show The Late Late Show with James Corden in January 2016, was the biggest YouTube viral video of 2016. At the 59th Annual Grammy Awards in February 2017, Adele won all five of her nominations, bringing her number of awards to fifteen. She won Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album for 25, and Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance for ""Hello"". She also performed a tribute to the late George Michael singing the rendition of his song ""Fastlove""; due to technical difficulties which occurred during the performance, Adele decided to stop and restart, explaining ""I can't mess this up for him"". As announced on 31 July 2017, Adele switched performance rights management in the US from BMI to SESAC.Adele was reportedly working on her fourth studio album by 2018. On 5 May 2019, her 31st birthday, Adele posted several black-and-white pictures of herself on her Instagram account celebrating the occasion along with a message reflecting on the preceding year. The message ended with, ""30 will be a drum n bass record to spite you"". Media outlets took the post as an indication that a new album was on the way. On 15 February 2020, Adele announced at a friend's wedding that her fourth studio album would be out by September 2020. However, she later confirmed that the album's production and release had been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Adele made her first television appearance in almost four years by hosting the 24 October 2020 episode of Saturday Night Live, with musical guest H.E.R.

On 1 October 2021, projections and billboards of the number ""30"" appeared on significant landmarks and buildings in different cities around the world, fuelling speculation that Adele was responsible, and that 30 would be the title of her fourth album. Soon after, Adele's website and social media accounts matched the aesthetic of the projections and billboards, hinting that her new album would be titled 30, which was subsequently confirmed. On 5 October 2021, Adele announced her single ""Easy on Me"" for release on 15 October. A release date of 19 November 2021 was announced for the album shortly thereafter. On 7 October, Adele was announced to be the November cover star on both Vogue and British Vogue, the first person to simultaneously cover both publications at the same time. On 15 October, Adele released ""Easy on Me"" to a positive reception, breaking Spotify and Amazon Music records for most streams for a song in a day. The song debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, Adele's third UK number one, and had the highest first-week sales for a single since January 2017. Debuting atop the Billboard Hot 100, it is her fifth US number-one single. 30 is her first album to be marketed globally by Columbia Records instead of being split between XL Recordings and Beggars Group's regional distribution partners in most of the world and Columbia in North America.","

Louise Alder,"Louise Alder was born in London and grew up in a family of musicians, playing the violin from an early age. Her father is a singer and her mother a violinist. She was a member of the London Schools Symphony Orchestra and also danced as a child.","Alder was educated at Lady Margaret School in Parsons Green, Fulham, London, followed by the University of Edinburgh, graduating with First Class Honours to join the Royal College of Music's International Opera School where she was the inaugural Kiri Te Kanawa scholar.

Alder received her first career break jumping in as Sophie in Der Rosenkavalier for Glyndebourne Festival Opera at the BBC Proms in 2014, where critics noted she was 'a sparkling Sophie who won all hearts' (Barry Millington, Evening Standard) and that she 'confirmed that she's ready for top billing' (Kimon Daltas, The Arts Desk). Since then Der Rosenkavalier has become something of a calling card for her, performing it at Oper Frankfurt (2016), Welsh National Opera (2017) and Glyndebourne Festival Opera (2018).

She has been a member of the solo ensemble at Oper Frankfurt since 2014, when she jumped in again to sing Gretel in a new production of Hänsel und Gretel directed by Keith Warner and conducted by Sebastian Weigle to notable acclaim. Other highlights there have included Susanna (Le Nozze di Figaro), Gilda (Rigoletto), Vixen (Cunning Little Vixen), Sophie (Werther), Sophie (Der Rosenkavalier) and Cleopatra (Giulio Cesare in Egitto). Elsewhere she has sung with Glyndebourne Festival Opera, The Royal Opera, Garsington and Welsh National Opera.

She performs recitals regularly at the Wigmore Hall with pianists Gary Matthewman, Joseph Middleton and James Baillieu and in concert halls all over the world, working with conductors such as Ivor Bolton, Sir Mark Elder, Robin Ticciati, Sebastian Weigle, Lorenzo Viotti, Jakub Hrůša, Christoph Rousset, Richard Egarr, Sir Richard Armstrong, Harry Bickett and Johannes Debus.

A passionate Handel singer, Alder sang the title role in Semele on tour with Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment in 2017, Atalanta in a new production of Xerxes at Oper Frankfurt also in 2017, the title role in Theodora at the BBC Proms in 2018 and Romilda (Xerxes) at Oper Frankfurt in January 2019. In December 2018 she sang Gretel (Hänsel und Gretel) at Bayerische Staatsoper and in March 2019, the title role in La Calisto at Teatro Real, Madrid. Future debuts include Canadian Opera Company, English National Opera and the Royal Opera House.

Her TV appearances have included a performance of Beethoven's Fidelio at the 2017 BBC Proms on BBC 4, BBC Cardiff Singer of the World 2017, Stars von Morgen 2017 on Arte, title role in L'incoronazione di Poppea with the Academy of Ancient Music at the Enescu Festival live on Romanian TVR2, and at the Coronation Gala at Buckingham Palace in 2013 in front of her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and the Royal Family, on BBC 1.

Kelli Ali,N/A,"Before Sneaker Pimps, Ali was part of a group called Psycho Drama, which she joined when she was 16 years old. A few years later, she was asked by Russell Cross of the band The Lumieres to join his band (as their songwriter, singer, and lead guitarist). The Lumieres only had one major single, ""Cinder Hearts"".

With the Sneaker Pimps she was featured prominently in both the songs and the music videos for the album Becoming X (the group finding fame following the release of the hit single ""6 Underground""). Ali was released from the group in 1998 when they decided to do vocals for their own songs.

After leaving the Sneaker Pimps, she moved on to a solo career under the name Kelli Ali. Her first solo album was Tigermouth in 2003, which included tracks ""Sunlight in the Rain"" and ""Kids,"" and featured ex-Doors drummer John Densmore. She toured alongside Garbage in 2003 and released a follow-up album, Psychic Cat, in mid-2004. The second album was more of a return to Ali's rock and roll roots and featured musician-turned-author Tony O'Neill on keyboards.

In April 2006, she travelled to Japan to record and write tracks with Hoshino Hidehiko from Buck-Tick and Cube Juice for the band Dropz. The same year, producer Paul Oakenfold recorded the Kelli Ali penned song ""Faster Kill Pussycat"" with actress Brittany Murphy, which remained Murphy's only single release.

On 24 November 2008, Ali released Rocking Horse, her third solo album. The album was produced by Max Richter (Fat Cat records) in Glasgow and Edinburgh in the first half of 2008. In 2009, she self-released the album Butterfly. Ali released her 5th album in 2013, entitled Band of Angels. She has collaborated extensively with the UK band Cult With No Name.

On 2 December 2016, on her Instagram feed Kelli Ali announced a new project, Ghostdriver. In her announcement Ali stated ""...it will be a joint album & film project. A noir thriller and love letter to London."" The project was being crowd-funded via a PledgeMusic campaign. On 30 December 2017 Ali posted an update to the site, stating, ""Thanks to you, all the filming for Ghostdriver was completed and the edit is in full swing, all songs written and in the later stages of production.""

On 24 November 2018, Ali released the lead single from ""Ghostdriver"" called ""The Fear Of London"" as a 7 track digital remix single, exclusively to fans who contributed to her PledgeMusic campaign. This was followed by an exclusive PledgeMusic-only digital release of the full 15 track ""Ghostdriver"" album on 26 January 2019, with an announcement that a full commercial release of the album and single will follow later in 2019 in conjunction with the release of the final film. In the album release announcement, Ali also revealed that her former Sneaker Pimps band-mate and notable producer & engineer, Liam Howe, contributed extensively to the mix and additional production of the album, notably marking the first collaboration between two original Sneaker Pimps band members since their disbandment.

As post-production work on the film continued through 2019, Ali released a stand-alone single called ""Sadistic"" (a new collaboration with producer Satoshi Tomiie, recorded during the ""Ghostdriver"" sessions and also features additional mix & production from Liam Howe) in December 2019 as a limited edition, deluxe Lipstick USB set and a new music video. The ""Ghostdriver"" film's post-production suffered delays in 2020 due to the Coronavirus pandemic. The soundtrack album was released November 26, 2020, with the film expected in 2021.

In September 2019, Kelli Ali appeared as a main feature in the Visual Collaborative electronic catalogue, in an issue themed Vivencias which translates to ""Experiences"" in Spanish. She was interviewed alongside 30 people from around the world such as Dakore Akande, Adelaide Damoah and Desdamona.

In 2021, Ali's song 'Rocking Horse' appeared on the soundtrack of the six-part Netflix series, Behind Her Eyes, based on the book of the same name.","

Ebony Alleyne,"Ebony Alleyne was signed to Sony Music at the age of 19 years old as a singer-songwriter. After much collaboration, the label found that they could not pigeon hole her style into the regular R&B approach for which they were known. Producers Ian Levine and Clive Scott were brought in to collaborate with Alleyne's style. Both felt that they should aim for a Dionne Warwick-Burt Bacharach approach - Alleyne penned the lyrics to ""Walk Away and Never Look Back"" with the Levine and Scott team. On the basis of this collaboration, Sony granted a £150,000 budget to produce an album with a full orchestra (sixty strings, thirty brass). ""Walk Away and Never Look Back"" sneak-previewed at a Togetherness soul weekend in 2002 and created further interest - three 7"" vinyl singles were pressed in a limited edition on the old soul label Okeh Records. In 2003, just as the album was ready to go into press, Sony Records underwent a management reshuffle.  One track ""All the Love in the World"" cropped up on Levine's Northern Soul 2004.

In early 2007, however, Expansion Records bought the rights to the album, and the Alleyne, Levine and Scott team returned to the studio to record one new track, ""You Caught Me Off Guard"", and added it to the track listing. The album Never Look Back was finally released in June 2007; launched at a release party at the Jazz Café in Camden Town. The album was released in Japan in late September with five bonus tracks, including a remix of ""You Caught Me Off Guard"". Alleyne recorded three new tracks - ""Mister Magic Man"", a duet with Noel McKoy ""Special Delivery"", and ""Have a Little Faith in Me"" for Levine's album Northern Soul 2007 and another track - ""Whistle for a Ride"" - for Disco 2008.",N/A,N/A,N/A,an English R&B and soul singer,1983,2000s,"Soul, R&B",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebony_Alleyne

She also modelled in Lemar's video for ""50:50"", and in So Solid's video for ""Broken Silence"".

In 2005, she signed up for Arts Council which provided her funding for music.

Sadie had wanted to be a singer when she was younger, but never properly pursued it until she met up with Terror Danjah (a grime producer), her friends cousin, who gave her a track for her to sing on.

Her sister Shola Ama was active in helping her write songs and teaching her how to make music. She was only 15 at the time it was released.

Jade Anderson,"Anderson was born in London as the youngest daughter of vocalist singer Jon Anderson, the frontman of progressive-rock band Yes. Anderson recalled performing with Ringo Starr when she was 8 years old, at her father's urging. She told Billboard that growing up with a celebrity father, she was exposed to many different kinds of people, which fostered in her a sense of openness.

At the age of 16, Anderson left home and moved in with some friends in public housing in London; the same year, she joined a ""female teen pop group."" She also began writing poetry at this time; she retrospectively described it as ""a way of [...] dealing with all the confusion of being a teenager."" Anderson eventually left the pop group and began collaborating with Eg White (also known as, simply, ""Eg""), a London songwriter.","In 2002, Anderson released her debut studio album, Dive Deeper, on Columbia Records. She had recorded the album with White in her basement, and it was produced at his London studio. Anderson wrote and recorded the album, and then was signed to Columbia, reportedly without her father's involvement. The album was initially slated to be released in Fall 2001, but its release was delayed, and it eventually came out on 14 May 2002. Stylistically, the record was noted for its mixture of ballads and dance-oriented songs, its extensive use of keyboards, and its Spanish influence. It has been classified as rock, pop, and pop-soul. The song ""Constant Talking"" criticizes gossip and is interspersed with chattering voices; it was thematically compared by AllMusic to The Go-Go's ""Our Lips are Sealed"". The song ""Sweet Memories"" (sometimes called ""Sunset Memories""), meanwhile, used a rhythm guitar in lieu of keyboards. In March 2002, it was announced that Anderson would soon embark on tour to promote the album.

Jade's biggest and only charting single, ""Sugarhigh,"" reached the Billboard Hot 100 and Dutch Singles Chart and was featured on several pop and dance compilations including Now That's What I Call Music! 10. Her second single, ""Sweet Memories"", received a favorable critical evaluation, but failed to impact the charts which ""Sugarhigh"" had entered.","Title—Details,Dive Deeper—* Released: 14 May 2002 * Label: Columbia  * Formats: CD *Track listing: #Intro #Sugarhigh #Constant Talking #Love Without Gold #Down #Falling #Sweet Memories #Forbidden Fruit #For Your Lessons #Nothing More #Before It Starts Again #Dive Deeper #Who's Loving You Now? #What I'd Do #You Held Me,Title—Year—US—US Dance—NL—Album,""Sugarhigh""—2002—96—37—85—Dive Deeper,""Sweetest Memories""—2002—Dive Deeper,",N/A,British singer-songwriter from the 2000s,1980,N/A,pop · R&B · rock,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Anderson

Julie Andrews,"Julia Elizabeth Wells was born on 1 October 1935 in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, England. Her mother, Barbara Ward Wells (née Morris; 1910–1984) was born in Chertsey and married Edward Charles ""Ted"" Wells (1908–1990), a teacher of metalwork and woodwork, in 1932. Andrews was conceived as a result of an affair her mother had with a family friend. Andrews discovered her true parentage from her mother in 1950, although it was not publicly disclosed until her 2008 autobiography.

With the outbreak of World War II, her parents went their separate ways and were soon divorced. Each remarried: Barbara to Ted Andrews, in 1943, and Ted Wells in 1944 to Winifred Maud (Hyde) Birkhead, a war widow and former hairstylist at a war work factory that employed them both in Hinchley Wood, Surrey. Wells assisted with evacuating children to Surrey during the Blitz, while Andrews's mother joined her husband in entertaining the troops through the Entertainments National Service Association. Andrews lived briefly with Wells and her brother, John in Surrey. In 1940, Wells sent her to live with her mother and stepfather, who Wells thought would be better able to provide for his talented daughter's artistic training. According to Andrews's 2008 autobiography Home, while Andrews had been used to calling her stepfather ""Uncle Ted"", her mother suggested it would be more appropriate to refer to her stepfather as ""Pop"", while her father remained ""Dad"" or ""Daddy"" to her, a change which she disliked. The Andrews family was ""very poor"" and ""lived in a bad slum area of London,"" at the time, stating that the war ""was a very black period in my life."" According to Andrews, her stepfather was violent and an alcoholic. He twice, while drunk, tried to get into bed with his stepdaughter, resulting in Andrews fitting a lock on her door.

As the stage career of her mother and stepfather improved, they were able to afford better surroundings, first to Beckenham and then, as the war ended, back to the Andrews's hometown of Hersham. The family took up residence at the Old Meuse, in West Grove, Hersham, a house (now demolished) where Andrews's maternal grandmother had served as a maid. Andrews's stepfather sponsored lessons for her, first at the independent arts educational school Cone-Ripman School (ArtsEd) in London, and thereafter with concert soprano and voice instructor Madame Lilian Stiles-Allen. Andrews said of Stiles-Allen, ""She had an enormous influence on me,"" adding, ""She was my third mother – I've got more mothers and fathers than anyone in the world."" In her memoir Julie Andrews – My Star Pupil, Stiles-Allen records, ""The range, accuracy and tone of Julie's voice amazed me ... she had possessed the rare gift of absolute pitch"", though Andrews herself refutes this in her 2008 autobiography Home. According to Andrews, ""Madame was sure that I could do Mozart and Rossini, but, to be honest, I never was"". Of her own voice, she says, ""I had a very pure, white, thin voice, a four-octave range – dogs would come from miles around."" After Cone-Ripman School, Andrews continued her academic education at the nearby Woodbrook School, a local state school in Beckenham.","Beginning in 1945, and for the next two years, Andrews performed spontaneously and unbilled on stage with her parents. ""Then came the day when I was told I must go to bed in the afternoon because I was going to be allowed to sing with Mummy and Pop in the evening,"" Andrews explained. During her initial shows, Andrews stood on a beer crate to sing into the microphone, performing a solo or a duet with her stepfather, while her mother played piano. She later stated that ""it must have been ghastly, but it seemed to go down all right."" Fellow child entertainer Petula Clark, three years her senior, recalled touring around the UK by train to sing for the troops alongside Andrews; they slept in the luggage racks. Clark later said ""It was fun—and not a lot of kids were having fun"".

Andrews had her career breakthrough when her stepfather introduced her to managing director Val Parnell, whose Moss Empires controlled prominent performance venues in London. At age 12, Andrews made her professional solo debut at the London Hippodrome, singing the difficult aria ""Je suis Titania"" from Mignon as part of a musical revue, called ""Starlight Roof"", on 22 October 1947. She played at the Hippodrome for one year. Of her role in ""Starlight Roof,"" Andrews recalled: ""There was this wonderful American person and comedian, Wally Boag, who made balloon animals. He would say, 'Is there any little girl or boy in the audience who would like one of these?' And I would rush up onstage and say, 'I'd like one, please.' And then he would chat to me and I'd tell him I sang ... I was fortunate in that I absolutely stopped the show cold. I mean, the audience went crazy.""

On 1 November 1948, a thirteen-year-old Andrews became the youngest solo performer ever to be seen in a Royal Variety Performance before King George VI and the future Queen Elizabeth at the London Palladium. Andrews performed alongside singer Danny Kaye, dancers the Nicholas Brothers, and the comedy team George and Bert Bernard.Andrews subsequently followed her parents into radio and television. She performed in musical interludes of the BBC Light Programme comedy show Up the Pole and was a cast member in Educating Archie, from 1950 to 1952. She reportedly made her television début on the BBC programme RadiOlympia Showtime on 8 October 1949. Andrews appeared on West End theatre at the London Casino, where she played one year each as Princess Badroulbadour in Aladdin and the egg in Humpty Dumpty. Andrews also appeared on provincial stages in Jack and the Beanstalk and Little Red Riding Hood, as well as starring as the lead role in Cinderella. In 1952, she voiced Princess Zeila in the English dub of the Italian animated movie La Rosa di Bagdad (renamed The Singing Princess), in her first film and first venture into voice-over work. On 30 September 1954, the eve of her 19th birthday, Andrews made her Broadway debut as Polly Browne in the London musical The Boy Friend. Andrews was recommended to director Vida Hope for the part by actress Hattie Jacques, whom Andrews regards as a ""catalyst"" for her career. Eve Benda recognized her special talent and predicted her stardom. Andrews was anxious about moving to New York; at the time, she was both breadwinner and caretaker for her family, and took the part upon her father's encouragement. She stated that at the time, she had ""no idea"" how to research a role or study a script, and cites Cy Feuer's direction as being ""phenomenal"". The Boy Friend became a hit, with Andrews receiving praise; critics called her the stand-out of the show.

In 1955, Andrews signed to appear with Bing Crosby in the television film, High Tor. It filmed in November 1955 in Los Angeles and was Andrews's first screen project, which she described as ""daunting"". High Tor was televised the following March before a live audience for the Ford Star Jubilee, receiving lukewarm reviews. Near the end of her one-year run with The Boy Friend, Andrews was approached to audition to Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe for the role of Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady. She was offered the part by Richard Rodgers during her third reading. She later wrote that she felt she could ""be Eliza, could find and understand her"" if only someone were to ""gently unravel the knotted ... string inside my stomach"".

During rehearsals, director Moss Hart spent forty-eight consecutive hours solely with Andrews, where they ""hammered through each scene""; Andrews later stated that ""the good man had stripped [her] feelings bare [...] molded, kneaded, and helped [her] become the character of Eliza [..] [and made] her part of [her] soul."" Andrews referred it as the best acting lesson she had ever received, later cementing the role with her ""own touches and flourishes"" and continuing to work on the character throughout her two-year run. On 15 March 1956, My Fair Lady opened on Broadway at the Mark Hellinger Theatre. The play was a huge success with both the audience and critics, though soon after opening she learned she needed to tone down her learned cockney accent so that the American audience could understand her, a change which was reversed at the West End performance a year later. Andrews describes her performances as Eliza as ""the great learning period"" of her life.

Rodgers was so impressed with Andrews's talent that concurrent with her run in My Fair Lady she was featured in the Rodgers and Hammerstein television musical Cinderella, which was written especially for her. Cinderella was broadcast live on CBS on 31 March 1957 under the musical direction of Alfredo Antonini and had an estimated 107 million viewers. The show was broadcast live in colour from CBS Studio 72, at Broadway and 81st Street in New York: CBS' only East Coast colour studio. Andrews was nominated for an Emmy Award for her role. She described the performance as ""incredibly hard"" and stated it took her ""years to realise the enormity"" of the production. In 1957, Andrews released her debut solo album, The Lass with the Delicate Air, which harked back to her British music hall days. The album includes performances of English folk songs as well as the World War II anthem, ""London Pride"", a patriotic song written by Noël Coward in 1941 during the Blitz, which Andrews herself had survived.

Between 1956 and 1962, Andrews guest-starred on The Ed Sullivan Show (15 July 1956), and also appeared on The Dinah Shore Chevy Show, What's My Line?, The Jack Benny Program, The Bell Telephone Hour, and The Garry Moore Show. In June 1962, Andrews co-starred in Julie and Carol at Carnegie Hall, a CBS special with Carol Burnett. In 1960, Lerner and Loewe again cast her in a period musical as Queen Guinevere in Camelot, along with Richard Burton (as King Arthur) and newcomer Robert Goulet. Andrews called the work ""monumental"" due to the heavy set costuming and detailed literary themes. Camelot premiered at the Majestic Theatre to ""adequate"" reviews, which Andrews credited to off-set production issues and comparisons to My Fair Lady. The musical was substantially revised both before and during the show's Broadway run.Casting for the film adaptation of My Fair Lady began in 1962; Jay Lerner hoped for Andrews to reprise her role, but Warner Brothers studio head Jack Warner decided Andrews lacked sufficient name recognition; the part was played by the established film actress Audrey Hepburn, with the bulk of the singing dubbed by Marni Nixon. As Warner later recalled that the decision was made for financial purposes, stating that ""In my business, I have to know who brings people and their money to a cinema box office. Audrey Hepburn had never made a financial flop."" Andrews later reflected that she understood her experience on Broadway ""was within a very small pond"" but wished she had been able to record her performance for posterity.

In 1963, Andrews began work in the titular role of Disney's musical film Mary Poppins. Walt Disney had seen her performance in Camelot and subsequently offered her the role; Andrews initially declined because of pregnancy, returning to London to give birth, but Disney firmly insisted, saying, ""We'll wait for you."" After the birth of her daughter, she received a call from P. L. Travers, author of the Mary Poppins book series, who told her, ""Well, you're much too pretty of course. But you've got the nose for it."" Disney rented a house in Toluca Lake, Los Angeles for her family to reside in during production. Andrews relied largely on instinct for her portrayal, conceptualising her background and giving the character a ""particular walk"" and a turned-out stance to suit her ladylike sensibility. Andrews referred to production as ""unrelenting"" given the physical exertion and technical details, saying that she ""could not have asked"" for a better introduction to film. Mary Poppins became the biggest box-office draw in Disney history. Variety lauded Andrews's performance as a ""signal triumph ... she performs as easily as she sings, displaying a fresh type of beauty."" The film was nominated for thirteen Academy Awards and won five, including the Academy Award for Best Actress for Andrews's performance. She also received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical, while Andrews and her co-stars won the 1965 Grammy Award for Best Album for Children. As a measure of ""sweet revenge,"" as Poppins songwriter Richard M. Sherman put it, Andrews closed her acceptance speech at the Golden Globes by saying, ""And, finally, my thanks to a man who made a wonderful movie and who made all this possible in the first place, Mr. Jack Warner."" My Fair Lady was in direct competition for the awards.

Andrews starred opposite James Garner in the comedy-drama war film The Americanization of Emily (1964). Andrews took the role partly to avoid typecasting as a nanny. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times called Andrews ""irresistible"".. with a brush of sentiment"" in both her comedic and emotional scenes. Andrews was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best British Actress in a Leading Role. Andrews later described it as her favourite film, a sentiment shared by her co-star Garner. Andrews starred in The Sound of Music (1965), which was the highest-grossing film of its year. Andrews later said she was ""ashamed"" to admit that she thought the musical ""rather saccharine"" before being cast.  Rehearsals took place in London before filming commenced in Salzburg, Austria in 1964. Filming was rather slow; due to weather conditions in Salzburg, the cast were ""lucky"" if they got a single shot's worth of scenes. Andrews stated she relied on lyrics to anchor her to the film's songs and utilisied vocal interpretation to ""convey"" Maria's character by ""[hanging] onto words and the images they conjured"". Andrews wrote that her senses were ""suffused"" with Austria, saying that the music ""still"" and ""always lives in her soul"". The film received mixed reviews, though critics highlighted Andrews's performance; Crowther again praised her for her ""air of radiant vigor ... plain-Jane wholesomeness and her ability to make her dialogue as vivid ... as she makes her songs."" For her performance as Maria von Trapp, Andrews won her second Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. She was nominated a second time for the Academy Award for Best Actress and the BAFTA Award for Best British Actress in a Leading Role. Andrews later wrote that the ""gift"" and ""privilege"" of portraying her first three film roles would have been ""enough to satisfy"" her for a lifetime.""

After completing The Sound of Music, Andrews appeared as a guest star on the NBC-TV variety series The Andy Williams Show. She followed this television appearance with an Emmy Award-winning special, The Julie Andrews Show, which featured Gene Kelly and the New Christy Minstrels as guests. It aired on NBC-TV in November 1965. In 1966, Andrews starred in Hawaii, the highest-grossing film of its year. Also in 1966, she starred opposite Paul Newman in Torn Curtain, which was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and shot at Universal Studios Hollywood. Hitchcock gave Newman and Andrews relative free rein in dialogue during production. She credits the director with teaching her extensively about lenses and camera-work. During a press interview, she ""made the mistake"" of expressing her unhappiness with her performance and subsequently received a ""terse"" letter from Hitchcock, which Andrews later cited as an ""important lesson"". The film received mixed reviews upon release.

The following year, she played the titular character in Thoroughly Modern Millie (1967). Andrews described work on the film as a ""pleasant distraction"" for ""allowing her to be something of a clown"", as her stepfather died shortly before filming. The film was a box office success; critics described Andrews as ""very much the leading lady"" and ""absolutely darling"" as well as ""deliciously spirited and dry."" The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards, and Andrews scored a Golden Globe nomination for her performance. At the time, Thoroughly Modern Millie and Torn Curtain were the biggest and second-biggest hits in Universal Pictures history, respectively. Andrews next appeared in two of Hollywood's most expensive flops: Star! (1968), a biopic of Gertrude Lawrence; and Darling Lili (1970), co-starring Rock Hudson and directed by her second husband, Blake Edwards. Andrews ""went through her usual period of insecurity"" during the production of Star!, intensely analysing her choices for the character. Choreographer Michael Kidd worked closely with Andrews during the complicated musical numbers, which Andrews regarded as physically and mentally gruelling, coupled with her divorce from her first husband, Tony Walton. The New York Times singled out the film as ""not one of [Andrews]'s best"", while Variety wrote her ""carefully built-up"" performance ""sagged"" with ""overdone hoydenishness"". Despite reviews, her performance was once again nominated for Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. Andrews regards her friendships with Kidd and director Robert Wise as her ""greatest gifts"" from the film.

Edwards pitched the concept of Darling Lili to Andrews two years prior to the start of production in 1968. She prerecorded original songs for the film with Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer. Andrews cited Darling Lili's tepid reviews as being caused by studio marketing and postproduction issues. While the film was a commercial bomb, the New York Times praised Andrews's performance, calling her an ""unmitigated delight"" and ""perfect centerpiece"" of the film, praising ""her coolness and precision as a comedienne and a singer"". She was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical, while the film won both the Golden Globe and Academy Awards for Best Original Song. Of these films, Andrews later wrote that ""nonstop success in a career is impossible [...] but nobody sets out to make a failure, either.""Andrews was the first choice to play the English witch Eglantine Price in Disney's Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971); Angela Lansbury was cast. Andrews continued working in television. In 1969, she shared the spotlight with singer Harry Belafonte for an NBC-TV special, An Evening with Julie Andrews and Harry Belafonte. In 1971, she appeared as a guest for the Grand Opening Special of Walt Disney World, and that same year she and Carol Burnett headlined a CBS special, Julie and Carol At Lincoln Center. In 1972–73, Andrews starred in her own television variety series, The Julie Andrews Hour, on the ABC network. The show won seven Emmy Awards but was cancelled after one season.

Between 1973 and 1975, Andrews continued her association with ABC by headlining five variety specials for the network. She guest-starred on The Muppet Show in 1977, and the following year, she appeared again with the Muppets on a CBS television variety special. The programme, Julie Andrews: One Step Into Spring, aired in March 1978, to mixed reviews and mediocre ratings. She made only two other films in the 1970s, The Tamarind Seed (1974) and 10 (1979), both successful at the box office and by critics' reviews. In February 1980, Andrews headlined ""Because We Care"", a CBS-TV special with 30 major stars raising funds for Cambodian Famine victims through Operation California (now Operation USA, on whose Board she serves). Later that year, she starred in Little Miss Marker as ""English rose"" Amanda Worthington (a label she had first been given in the 1960s). In Blake Edwards' S.O.B. (1981), she played Sally Miles, a character who agrees to ""show my boobies"" in a scene in the film-within-a-film.A dual role of Victoria Grant and Count Victor Grezhinski in the film Victor/Victoria (1982), reunited her with Garner once again. Her performance earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical, as well as a nomination for the 1982 Academy Award for Best Actress, her third Oscar nomination. In 1983, Andrews was chosen as the Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year by the Harvard University Theatrical Society. That year, she co-starred with Burt Reynolds in The Man Who Loved Women. Her next two films were That's Life! and Duet for One (both 1986), which earned her Golden Globe nominations. In December 1987, Andrews starred in an ABC Christmas special, Julie Andrews: The Sound Of Christmas, which went on to win five Emmy Awards. Two years later, she was reunited for the third time with Carol Burnett for a variety special which aired on ABC in December 1989.In 1991, Andrews made her television dramatic debut in the ABC made-for-TV film, Our Sons, co-starring Ann-Margret. Andrews was named a Disney Legend within the year. In the summer of 1992, Andrews starred in her first television sitcom; the short-lived Julie aired on ABC for only seven episodes and co-starred James Farentino. In December, 1992 she hosted the NBC holiday special, Christmas In Washington. Having played a Cockney flower seller in My Fair Lady, Andrews had an orangey-salmon pink rose named after her at London's Chelsea Flower Show in 1992. Stating she was ""ever so flattered"", portions of the sales of the ""Julie Andrews Rose"" were donated to charity. In 1993, she starred in a limited run at the Manhattan Theatre Club in the American premiere of Stephen Sondheim's revue, Putting It Together. Between 1994 and 1995, Andrews recorded two solo albums – the first saluted the music of Richard Rodgers and the second paid tribute to the words of Alan Jay Lerner. In 1995, she starred in the stage musical version of Victor/Victoria. It was her first appearance in a Broadway show in 35 years. Opening on Broadway on 25 October 1995 at the Marquis Theatre, it later went on the road for a world tour. When she was the only Tony Award nominee for the production, she declined the nomination saying that she could not accept because she felt the entire production was snubbed.

Despite the loss of her singing voice, she kept busy with many projects. In 1998, she appeared in a stage production of Dr. Dolittle in London. As recounted on the Julie Andrews website, she performed the voice of Polynesia the parrot and ""recorded some 700 sentences and sounds, which were placed on a computer chip that sat in the mechanical bird's mouth. In the song 'Talk to the Animals,' Polynesia the parrot even sings."" The next year Andrews was reunited with James Garner for the CBS made-for-TV film, One Special Night, which aired in November 1999.In the 2000 New Year Honours List, Andrews was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) for services to the performing arts and received the award from Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace. In 2002, Andrews was among the guests at the Queen's Golden Jubilee Hollywood party held at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. She also appears at No.59 on the 2002 poll of the ""100 Greatest Britons"" sponsored by the BBC and chosen by the British public. In 2001, Andrews received Kennedy Center Honors. The same year, she reunited with Sound of Music co-star Christopher Plummer in a live television performance of On Golden Pond (an adaptation of the 1979 play). Andrews appeared in The Princess Diaries, her first Disney film since Mary Poppins. She starred as Queen Clarisse Marie Renaldi and reprised the role in the 2004 sequel, The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement. In the film, Andrews sang on film for the first time since having throat surgery. The song, ""Your Crowning Glory"", a duet with Raven-Symoné, was set in a limited range of an octave to accommodate her recovering voice. The film's music supervisor, Dawn Soler, recalled that Andrews ""nailed the song on the first take. I looked around and I saw grips with tears in their eyes.""

Andrews continued her association with Disney when she appeared as the nanny in two television films based on the Eloise books, a series of children's books by Kay Thompson about a child who lives in the Plaza Hotel in New York City. Eloise at the Plaza premiered in April 2003, and Eloise at Christmastime was broadcast in November 2003; Andrews was nominated for an Emmy Award. The same year she made her debut as a theatre director, directing a revival of The Boy Friend, the musical in which she made her 1954 Broadway debut, at the Bay Street Theatre in Sag Harbor, New York. Her production, which featured costume and scenic design by her former husband Tony Walton, was remounted at the Goodspeed Opera House in 2005 and went on a national tour in 2006. From 2005 to 2006, Andrews served as the Official Ambassador for Disneyland's 18-month-long, 50th-anniversary celebration, the ""Happiest Homecoming on Earth"", travelling to promote the celebration, recording narration and appearing at several events at the park. On 17 March 2005, Andrews appeared onstage during the curtain calls for the musical of Mary Poppins at the Prince Edward Theatre in London's West End, where she gave a speech recalling her own memories from making the film and praised the cast for their new interpretation. In 2004, Andrews voiced Queen Lillian in the animated blockbuster Shrek 2 (2004), reprising the role for its sequels, Shrek the Third (2007) and Shrek Forever After (2010). Also in 2007, she narrated Enchanted, a live-action Disney musical comedy that both parodied and paid homage to Disney films.

On 1 May 2005, Disneyland debuted a new fireworks show, Remember... Dreams Come True, for Disneyland's 50th anniversary, with Andrews being the host and narrator of the show. In January 2007, Andrews was honoured with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Screen Actors Guild's awards and stated that her goals included continuing to direct for the stage and possibly to produce her own Broadway musical. She published Home: A Memoir of My Early Years, which she characterised as ""part one"" of her autobiography, on 1 April 2008. Home chronicles her early years in Britain's music hall circuit and ends in 1962 with her winning the role of Mary Poppins. For a Walt Disney video release, she again portrayed Mary Poppins and narrated the story of The Cat That Looked at a King in 2004. From July until early August 2008, Andrews hosted Julie Andrews' The Gift of Music, a short tour of the United States where she sang various Rodgers and Hammerstein songs and symphonised her recently published book, Simeon's Gift. Appearances included the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, the Mann Center for the Performing Arts in Philadelphia, and a performance with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. These were her first public singing performances in a dozen years, due to her failed vocal cord surgery. In January 2009, Andrews was named on The Times' list of the top 10 British Actresses of all time. The list included Helen Mirren, Helena Bonham Carter, Judi Dench, and Audrey Hepburn. On 8 May 2009, Andrews received the honorary George and Ira Gershwin Award for Lifetime Achievement in Music at the annual UCLA Spring Sing competition in Pauley Pavilion.In January 2010, Andrews was the official United States presenter for the Great Performances From Vienna: The New Year's Celebration 2010 concert. This was her second appearance in this role, after presenting the previous year's concert. Andrews also had a supporting role in the film Tooth Fairy, which opened to unfavourable reviews although the box office receipts were successful. On her promotion tour for the film, she also spoke of Operation USA and the aid campaign to the Haiti disaster. On 8 May 2010, Andrews made her London comeback after a 21-year absence (her last performance there was a Christmas concert at the Royal Festival Hall in 1989). She performed at The O2 Arena, accompanied by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and an ensemble of five performers. Earlier (on 15 December 2009 and on many other occasions), she appeared on British television saying that rumours that she would be singing at the performance were not true and that she would be doing a form of ""speak singing"". Yet she actually sang two solos and several duets and ensemble pieces. The evening, though well received by the 20,000 fans present, who gave her standing ovation after standing ovation, did not convince the critics.

On 18 May 2010, Andrews's 23rd book (this one also written with her daughter Emma) was published. In June 2010, the book, entitled The Very Fairy Princess, reached number 1 on The New York Times Best Seller List for Children's Books. On 21 May 2010, her film Shrek Forever After was released; in it Andrews reprises her role as the Queen. On 9 July 2010, Despicable Me, an animated film in which Andrews lent her voice to Marlena Gru, the thoughtless and soul-crushing mother of the main character Gru (voiced by Steve Carell), opened to rave reviews and strong box office. On 28 October 2010, Andrews appeared, along with the actors who portrayed the cinematic von Trapp family members, on Oprah to commemorate the film's 45th anniversary. A few days later, her 24th book, Little Bo in Italy, was published. On 15 December 2010, Andrews's husband Blake Edwards died at the age of 88, of complications of pneumonia at the Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California. Andrews was by her husband's side when he died. In February 2011, Andrews received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and, with her daughter Emma, a Grammy for best spoken-word album for children (for A Collection of Poems, Songs and Lullabies), at the 53rd Grammy Awards. In her memoir, Home Work (2019), Andrews discussed being offered the role of Aunt Emma by Martin Scorsese for his film The Wolf of Wall Street (2013). Unfortunately, she declined, citing a recent surgery and she wasn't ""ready to go back to work"" but ""would've loved to have done it"". At the age of 77, Andrews undertook her first tour of Australia and New Zealand in 2013, hosted by Nicholas Hammond who was a boy of 14 when they appeared together in The Sound of Music. In place of singing, she planned a series of speaking engagements in Australia's five mainland state capitals. The following year she took the show on a tour of England, which was hosted by Aled Jones. The tour began with a May date at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham and included an appearance at the Echo Arena in Liverpool.

In 2015, Andrews made a surprise appearance at the Oscars, greeting Lady Gaga who paid her homage by singing a medley from The Sound of Music. This became a social media sensation, trending all over the world. Lyndon Terracini announced in August 2015 that Andrews would direct My Fair Lady in 2016 for Opera Australia at the Sydney Opera House. In 2016, Andrews created the preschool television series Julie's Greenroom with her daughter, Emma Walton Hamilton and Judy Rothman. Andrews is joined by her assistant Gus (Giullian Yao Gioiello) and “Greenies,” a cast of original puppets built by The Jim Henson Company. The series premiered on Netflix in 2017. In 2017, Andrews also reprised her role as Marlena Gru in the second Despicable Me sequel Despicable Me 3. In 2018, Andrews voiced Karathen, a leviathan, in James Wan's Aquaman. That same year, she declined a cameo appearance in Mary Poppins Returns to avoid stealing the limelight now belonging to star Emily Blunt.Beginning in December 2020, Andrews voiced the narrator Lady Whistledown in the Netflix period drama series Bridgerton.",N/A,N/A,"British actress, singer and author",1/9/1935,1945–present,N/A,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Andrews

Gabrielle Aplin,"Aplin grew up in Chippenham in Wiltshire. She is the eldest of three children. Aplin's parents bought her her first guitar when she was 11 years old. She is a fan of the singer-songwriters Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen, as well as the rock band The National.

Her second release, another extended play titled Never Fade, was released on 9 May 2011. In this EP, she expanded her sound, showcasing a more folk rock sound and playing all the instruments herself. In April 2011, Aplin was invited to perform for BBC Introducing at Maida Vale Studios, where she played three tracks from Never Fade and a cover of the Coldplay song ""Fix You,"" which was the most-viewed video on the BBC Introducing YouTube channel. Aplin released her third EP, Home, on 12 February 2012, again under Never Fade Records. She described Home as ""the most honest thing I've ever written and recorded.""On 29 February 2012, Aplin announced that she had signed a deal with Parlophone Records.

In February 2017, Aplin parted ways with Parlophone Records to focus on releasing material via her own independent record label, Never Fade Records. She said of the decision, ""I really enjoy getting involved with everything—from my image to my artwork. It's been quite nice to be in control.""

Lisa Armstrong (make-up artist),"Armstrong was born and brought up in Blackbird Leys, Oxford, England, living with her parents and one older brother Stephen. She attended Peers School, Oxford, but at the age of 14 won a place at BRIT School for Performing Arts & Technology in Croydon, south London.","Armstrong started her career as a dancer from an early age but when her friend, Kelly O'Keefe had work experience with a music management company and was asked to put together a band, she joined Deuce alongside Kelly O'Keefe, Craig Young and Paul Holmes. Their debut single, ""Call It Love"" was released in January 1994, entered the UK charts at number 21 and worked its way up to peak at number 11. The band went on to release two more singles and an album before O'Keefe decided to leave the band in November 1995 and the band were dropped from their label. The band decided to continue on a new label and O'Keefe was replaced by Amanda Perkins, for one single, before they disbanded.

She then chose to train as a make-up artist, writing a column for Cosmopolitan magazine before becoming the make-up artist for many British television shows such as The X Factor, Britain's Got Talent and many of Ant & Dec's shows. Armstrong was also the make-up expert on This Morning, giving makeovers and short make-up tutorials.

She is now head of make-up and hair for BBC One's Strictly Come Dancing.

Hannah Arterton,"Arterton was born on 26 January 1989 in Gravesend, Kent, England. Her mother Sally-Anne (née Heap) is a cleaner and runs a cleaning business and her father Barry J. Arterton is a metal worker welder. Her parents divorced during her early childhood with Arterton growing up with her older sister Gemma Arterton and mother in a council estate. She reports being initially drawn to acting at the age of seven after watching a rehearsal of the musical The Wizard of Oz performed by The Miskin Theatre in Dartford. Arterton recalled: ""I'd never seen anything like that. I was absolutely blown away... A whole different world just opened up."" Her matrilineal great-grandmother was a German-Jewish concert violinist.

Her early education was at the Gravesend Grammar School for Girls. She subsequently studied Performance and Music Technology at North Kent College's Miskin Theatre. While studying there, she provided backing vocals for a skiffle band which resulted in a record deal offer which later collapsed. She commented on the experience: ""'Argh, I can't do this. It's too hard to trust people in the music industry. It's full of sharks and guys latching on to a young artist and wanting to make money. I found it all quite scary."" A lecturer at The Miskin Theatre subsequently convinced her to apply for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), from which she later graduated in 2011. During her final year at RADA, she was cast by Stephen Poliakoff in his play My City. Also while at RADA, Arterton formed a seven-piece covers band The Hitmen and Her for which she is the lead singer.","After performing in the play, My City (2011) with Tracey Ullman and Tom Riley at the Almeida Theatre, Arterton was then cast as Korinna in the BBC television series Atlantis (2013).

Her feature film debut was as a woman caught in a love triangle in the romantic musical Walking on Sunshine (2014). Her performance received generally positive reviews from critics. In the same year, she starred in Hide and Seek (2014), a romantic drama about a polyamorous commune which received the Edinburgh International Film Festival's award for Best British Feature Film.

In 2016, she played a detective in American crime novelist Harlan Coben's television series The Five. Two years later, Arterton reunited with Coben to play detective Emma Castle in Netflix original series Safe. In the same year, she appeared in two horror films directed by Paul Hyett, The Convent, and Peripheral.",N/A,N/A,British actor and singer,1989,2011–present,N/A,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Arterton

Jay Aston,"Aston married guitarist Dave Colquhoun in August 1999 in Greenwich, London. They have a daughter, Josie Alexandra (born 2003, Bromley, Greater London). In 2011 they lived in Tatsfield, Surrey. Aston's mother Hilda died in 2007, while her father Ted died in 2009. Aston continues to teach dance and performance at her performing arts school in Kent. She was diagnosed with mouth cancer in June 2018. Since then, she has had surgery, and the outlook is said to be ""positive"". In January 2021, Aston announced that she had been diagnosed with Covid-19 but was recovering.","Aston was born in Purley, Surrey, and came from a theatrical family. Her father was a comedian, while her mother had been a dancer before becoming her husband's straight man. They also performed as acrobats. Her brother Lance performed at the 1980 Eurovision Song Contest with the band Prima Donna. Aston herself trained as a dancer, singer and actress at the Italia Conti School of Speech and Drama and performed on stage many times in her teens, mainly as a dancer. She was named ""Miss Purley"" in 1978 and competed in the subsequent Miss England contest, in which she was unplaced. The interval act at the televised Miss England 1978 competition was the group Co-Co, who had just been selected to represent Britain in the Eurovision Song Contest 1978 and featured Cheryl Baker in the line-up.Aston was, along with Baker, one of the four members of Bucks Fizz when they were formed in 1981 to compete in that year's Eurovision Song Contest. They won with ""Making Your Mind Up""; the song went to number one in many countries, including the United Kingdom. The group went on to become one of the top-selling groups of the 1980s, scoring many hit singles and albums over the next few years, including two more British number ones: ""The Land of Make Believe"" and ""My Camera Never Lies"". Aston designed many of the group's stage outfits. In 1983 she performed the lead vocal on the song ""When We Were Young"", which went on to become one of the group's biggest hits.

Aston became known for her love of physical exercise, and released a keep-fit album in early 1984 called Shape Up and Dance. She was the victim of an attack while out jogging, but fought off the attacker and recovered from the incident.

In December 1984, while on tour, Bucks Fizz were involved in a tour coach crash, in which Nolan was seriously injured. By this time, tensions within the group had risen to the point that Aston was eager to leave, but was still under contract. However, the following year, she left the group in acrimonious circumstances. Aston became the subject of many newspaper headlines on her sudden departure where it emerged that she had had an affair with the group's producer, Andy Hill, who was also the husband of Bucks Fizz creator Nichola Martin. The group's management company took Aston to court under the terms of her contract, but later agreed to release her. However, an injunction was placed on her against commencing a solo career, which took two years to settle and resulted in her selling her Kensington home. In addition, all eight cases were settled out of court after the case was investigated by the attorney general.Forced to sell her house, Aston was living in a small bedsit in Croydon on housing benefits in the early 1990s. Her brother had married Shakespear's Sister star Marcella Detroit who encouraged her to record new songs. In 1993 Aston released a single, ""Naked Phoenix"", and recorded an album of songs. This same year she contributed a song to the controversial Michael Winner film Dirty Weekend, although Aston walked out of the film's premiere in disgust. By 1995 she was living with her parents but was still writing and recording music. Around this time she met and began dating guitarist Dave Colquhoun, whom she married in 1999. During the latter part of the 1990s and early 2000s, Aston toured with her band Aston, performing rock and pop tracks, many of which she wrote herself. In 2002 she was involved in a cover band called Monster Boogie, and she also appeared in an episode of Never Mind the Buzzcocks as one of the mystery guests in the identity parade round. The following year she released an album, Alive and Well, featuring 13 tracks, all of which she co-wrote with her husband.

The glory years of Bucks Fizz, mainly focusing on Aston, were portrayed in 2005 in a drag lip-synch show, Night of a Thousand Jay Astons, at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe after its début in London. Aston was played by one female and three male performers. The life of Aston was told through an outrageous parody, and was described in review as ""hilariously over the top"". The show has also been staged at other venues, including the Comedy Theatre in Dublin in May 2006 and the Soho Theatre in London in summer 2007.

Another solo album, a three-disc box-set Lamb or Lizard, was released in July 2006 through her website, which featured recordings from before and after her work with Bucks Fizz.

In 2001, she set up a performing arts school in her name, The Jay Aston Theatre Arts School, teaching children aged between two and 17. The school still runs today.

In March 2007, she appeared in the Comic Relief video ""I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)"" a comic cover version of the Proclaimers song, dancing with the other three original members of Bucks Fizz, and also Shelley Preston, who had replaced Aston in the group in 1985. This was the first time that Aston had met the group since 1985. She said that relations between them had improved, but not the extent that could work together as a group again: ""I'm kind of on good terms with all of them individually. But as a band, it just doesn't work, and it's a shame, but it doesn't. There's always been two camps – Cheryl's camp and Bobby's camp, and I was the one in Bobby's camp, and Mike was always in Cheryl's camp.""

A new Bucks Fizz CD with a bonus DVD, The Very Best of Bucks Fizz, was released in May 2007. Aston appeared alone on the National Lottery to promote the album. In August 2008, Aston once again joined up with Bucks Fizz members Mike Nolan, Cheryl Baker and Shelley Preston, when she appeared on a television show celebrating 1980s acts – with one episode devoted to the reuniting of Bucks Fizz. This programme was shown on Living TV in March 2009.

In May 2013, Aston appeared on the second series of UK singing talent show The Voice, singing Muse's """"Time is Running Out"""", but was not chosen by any of the judges. Aside from her duties in the Fizz, Aston has also appeared in pantomime a number of times. In 2019 She appeared as the Wicked Step Mother in Snow White at the Queens Theatre Barnstaple.In 2004, Bucks Fizz members Cheryl Baker, Mike Nolan and Shelley Preston reunited to form the Original Bucks Fizz and performed in concert throughout the UK. In April 2009, Preston announced that she was leaving the group and Aston agreed to join – the first time she had been a part of Bucks Fizz since 1985. Since then, they have toured the UK extensively and have released three albums to date, one of them, The F–Z of Pop, becoming a top 30 hit in the UK Charts. They currently perform under the name the Fizz.Before Bucks Fizz, Aston had ambitions to become an actress, but her career in this field encompassed only minor roles in To the Manor Born and Citizen Smith. In 2008, Aston was cast as Claudia Brite in the film The Last Days of Edgar Harding which was shot in August 2008 and screened in 2010. The film has never seen a mainstream release.","

Keedie Babb,N/A,"In 2003 Keedie appeared in a local Torquay talent show, ""Stairway to the Stars""; this appearance brought her to fame. On 30 November 2003, Keedie performed at a World AIDS Day event at the Coronet theatre in London together with Liberty X in aid of Crusaid.

In 2004, Keedie signed a seven figure music deal with EMI Classics, after she duetted with former Blue member Duncan James, on ""I Believe My Heart"", the soundtrack to the Andrew Lloyd Webber Musical, The Woman in White. The single reached number two in the UK Singles Chart. She also performed at the Miami and Washington Film Festivals.

Her second single, a cover version of the hymn ""Jerusalem"", was released as a charity single in the UK on 18 December 2005, and entered the UK chart at #19.

Proceeds of the single were split equally between the Save the Children's ""Children in Emergencies Appeal"" and two cricket charities.

Her debut album I Believe My Heart was released on 18 November 2004, and met with positive reviews. It includes a variety of contemporary tracks and arrangements, and also featured the title theme ""My Reason"", from the film Modigliani; the video for which Keedie filmed on location in Bucharest. The album includes two pop covers: Madonna's ""You'll See"" and Enya's ""Only Time"", seven original songs and nine arias.

It was the first live concert Tina Turner had performed in seven years. Keedie was the only artist to support Turner at the charity gig and she performed in front of celebrities such as Richard Hammond, Tara Palmer Tompkinson and David Gest.

Keedie said after the gig: It was probably one of the most amazing nights I have ever seen. It was mind-blowing. I have never seen anything like it. There was so many celebrities there. When I performed I had a standing ovation and Tina's bouncer told me she had been watching me and had said I was phenomenal. It was really nerve-wracking.

Keedie was then invited to sing before David Beckham's first match for Los Angeles Galaxy in the United States. She was also booked for a private party for George Clooney and another charity gig in Moscow which was organised by Nelson Mandela.

In May 2007, a special charity album entitled KN21 was released in aid of Children's Hospice South-West. The album consisted of live recordings of Keedie and her sister Nadine from 1993 – when they were 11 and 10 years old, and called themselves KN21 – a name using the first initials of their names plus their combined age at the time. The tracks are mainly covers from the 1960s which were recorded during the girls ""Swinging Sixties"" show at the Great Western Hotel in Paignton. The album also has two exclusive bonus tracks which Keedie recorded in 2005 – ""Nessun Dorma"" and ""Would I Know"", an original song penned by American songwriter, Diane Warren, and previously used in the Charlotte Church film I'll Be There.

Baby Blue (rapper),"Prager started rapping while at school and eventually recorded a track called ""I Woulda"", which was inspired by her cousin's gang-related death in the U.S.. The track received heavy rotation and was the start of Prager's career as a recording artist. When she was 19, she sent a demo of her music to UK artist Estelle, who invited her to New York City to record the song ""Hey Girl"" featuring John Legend, as well as ""Don't Talk"", another track for Estelle's début album The 18th Day, which was certified gold in the UK. Baby Blue was also featured rapping in the video for the top 20 Estelle hit ""1980"".

Later that year, Blue released the mixtape Out of the Blue Vol. I (with Volume II released two years later) which featured Estelle, members of So Solid Crew, Shystie, Sway, and Akala. Her first solo music video was for the single ""Sometimes"", which was released to push Vol. II of the mixtape. This led Mobo Magazine to dub her ""The Uncrowned Queen of the UK"" and MTV to list her as ""one of the hottest up 'n' coming stars"".

Baby Blue featured on new wave ska band Madness's comeback single ""Sorry"" in 2007, which went to 23 in the UK singles chart and was on the soundtrack for FIFA 08. She toured with Estelle for four months, travelling around the U.S. and Europe. She has also worked with Ms. Dynamite, Kardinal Offishall, and Idris Elba.

In 2010, in an interview with thekoalition.com, Baby Blue stated that she was working on an EP to be released in March 2010, and an album to be released later on in the same year. On 17 March that year, Baby Blue released a digital mixtape entitled Firefly. It was revealed that the title of her album would be called No Smoke Without Fire.

On 20 July 2012, Baby Blue announced via Twitter that she has been signed by 3 Beat/Universal.

On 26 July 2013, Baby Blue announced she had spent time in the recording studio with So Solid Crew singer Lisa Maffia, with each artist both contributing to forthcoming albums.

In 2018, Prager-Riel became ""Head of Music"" at 7Wallace, the record label founded by Idris Elba in 2015. In a joint venture with Universal Music Publishing, the company has expanded to include music publishing and has set up studios in Central London and Oxford.",N/A,"

Before auditioning for The X Factor, she worked as a prison officer at HMP Gartree. near Market Harborough, Leicestershire. In an interview on Daybreak the day after winning, Bailey said that she would quit her job at the Prison.","In 1996, then 18-year-old Bailey formed the ska duo Girls Next Door with her friend Julie Nunney and they recorded a song called ""Too Late"", which was produced by Right Said Fred bassist Clyde Ward. It was reported that Simon Cowell heard the song when he was shopping at his local Asda, but turned the duo down because they were not on television, but Bailey later said that this story was not true.In 2013, Bailey auditioned for the tenth series of The X Factor in front of judges Gary Barlow Sharon Osbourne, Nicole Scherzinger and Louis Walsh, singing Beyoncé's ""Listen"" in her room audition. She received a standing ovation from all four judges afterwards, with Barlow calling her voice ""incredible"". She was given four ""yeses"" and progressed through to the arena auditions. She sang ""Who's Lovin' You"" and ""Run To You"" at the arena, gaining another standing ovation from the audience and bringing Scherzinger to tears. She received four yeses again. Bailey was placed in the ""over 25s"" category at ""bootcamp"" and was mentored by Osbourne. She successfully made it through to ""judges' houses"" and was later chosen by Osbourne for the live shows, along with Lorna Simpson and Shelley Smith.

Following the eliminations of Simpson in week 1 and Smith in week 2, Bailey became the last over 25 in the competition. On 8 December, she made it to the final along with Nicholas McDonald and Luke Friend. On 14 December, she duetted with Scherzinger on ""And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going"". The following night, she sang her winner's single, a cover of ""Skyscraper"" by Demi Lovato. Later, having received more than 1 million votes over the course of the weekend, she was announced as the winner. When the voting statistics were announced on The X Factor afterwards, Bailey was revealed to have received the most public votes seven times out of ten. As the winner, she received a £1 million recording contract with Syco Music and the opportunity to support Beyoncé on the UK leg of The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour in February 2014. Bailey was reportedly due to support Beyoncé at ten shows, but that figure was cut down to just one due to The X Factor Live Tour. Her sole show with Beyonce was in Birmingham on 24 February 2014.

A report by The Sun claimed that Bailey had ""misled the public"" by stating she had no previous singing experience, when in fact she had been performing on cruise ships, in clubs and at music festivals for several years. Bailey defended herself in an interview with the Leicester Mercury, stating: ""I have been totally honest that I have sang for 20 years but never made it. What's the problem with that?"" An X Factor executive producer also revealed that Bailey had auditioned for the show's fourth series in 2007, but did not get past the first producers' round.Room audition—""Listen"" - Beyoncé—N/A—Through to arena audition,Arena audition—""Who's Lovin' You"" - The Jackson 5/""Run To You"" - Whitney Houston—N/A—Through to bootcamp,Bootcamp—""I'm Every Woman"" - Whitney Houston—N/A—Through to six chair challenge,Six chair challenge—""Clown"" - Emeli Sandé—N/A—Through to judges' houses,Judges' houses—""I Have Nothing"" - Whitney Houston/""Without You"" - Mariah Carey—N/A—Through to live shows,Live show 1—""The Power of Love"" - Jennifer Rush—Songs from the 1980s—Saturday - Safe (1st),Live show 1—""The Power of Love"" - Jennifer Rush—Songs from the 1980s—Sunday - Safe (2nd),Live show 2—""Make You Feel My Love"" - Bob Dylan—Love and heartbreak—Saturday - Safe (2nd),Live show 2—""Make You Feel My Love"" - Bob Dylan—Love and heartbreak—Sunday - Safe (2nd),Live show 3—""My Heart Will Go On"" - Celine Dion—Movie week—Saturday - Safe (1st),Live show 3—""My Heart Will Go On"" - Celine Dion—Movie week—Sunday - Safe (1st),Live show 4—""No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)"" - Barbra Streisand & Donna Summer—Disco—Safe (1st),Live show 5—""New York, New York"" - Liza Minnelli—Big band—Safe (1st),Live show 6—""Something"" - The Beatles—The Great British Songbook—Safe (2nd),Live show 7—""Bleeding Love"" - Leona Lewis—The Best of The X Factor—Safe (1st),Quarter-Final—""How Will I Know"" - Whitney Houston—Musical heroes—Safe (1st),Quarter-Final—""Clown"" - Emeli Sandé—Jukebox—Safe (1st),Semi-Final—""If I Were a Boy"" - Beyoncé—Elton John vs. Beyoncé—Safe (1st),Semi-Final—""Candle in the Wind"" - Elton John—Elton John vs. Beyoncé—Safe (1st),Final (Part 1)—""The Edge of Glory"" - Lady Gaga—No theme—Safe (1st),Final (Part 1)—""And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going"" - Jennifer Hudson (with Nicole Scherzinger)—Celebrity duet—Safe (1st),Final (Part 2)—""The Power of Love"" - Jennifer Rush—Song of the series—Winner,Final (Part 2)—""Skyscraper"" - Demi Lovato—Winners single—Winner,Bailey's winner's single ""Skyscraper"" was released via digital download on 16 December 2013, the day after she won the show.

On 22 December, the song debuted atop the UK Singles Chart after selling 149,000 copies in its first week and became the Christmas number one.

In an interview with the Official Charts Company after ""Skyscraper"" topped the charts, Bailey said, ""2014 is going to be a huge year for me. Basically, I'm in the studio pretty much straight away. We're hoping to get an album out for spring. On the album, I'm going to try and do things a little bit differently."" On 21 January 2014, Bailey tweeted that her debut album would be called The Power of Love, named after the Jennifer Rush song which Bailey covered for the album.

Bat for Lashes,"Khan was born to an English mother and an immigrant Pakistani father, professional squash player Rehmat Khan. A member of the Khan family, she is the granddaughter of squash player Nasrullah Khan, the niece of squash players Jahangir Khan and Torsam Khan, the stepdaughter of singer and actress Salma Agha, and half-sister of actress Sasha Agha. The family moved to Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, when she was five years old. She attended many of her father's and her uncle Jahangir's squash matches, which she felt inspired her creativity: ""The roar of the crowd is intense; it is ceremonial, ritualistic, I feel like the banner got passed to me but I carried it on in a creative way. It is a similar thing, the need to thrive on heightened communal experience."" After her father left the family when Khan was 11, she taught herself to play the piano, which became ""a channel to express things, to get them out"".

Khan was subject to racial abuse during secondary school for being of Pakistani heritage, played truant, and was suspended after swearing and throwing a chair at a teacher. She told The Daily Telegraph: ""I was an outsider at school. When I came back from being suspended they had told the small group of friends that I did have there that they weren't allowed to talk to me because I was a really bad influence. Then it got quite lonely."" After completing her GCSEs and A-Levels, Khan took a job in a card-packing factory where she would work while listening to songs she had made. She said: ""My internal imaginary life was really fruitful at that time...All day long just listening and dreaming, while counting the cards to be packed."" With money saved from the job, she embarked on a three-month road trip through the United States and Mexico.

After returning to the UK, Khan settled in Brighton in 2000 to study music and visual arts at the University of Brighton, where she produced sound installations, animations, and performances influenced by artists including Steve Reich and Susan Hiller. After finishing her degree, Khan completed an NVQ in play work and childcare, and worked as a nursery school teacher, dedicating her spare time to developing songs, recording demos, and gigging in Brighton. She has said the name Bat for Lashes ""doesn’t really mean anything [...] It conjured up Halloween-y images, and it sounded metal and feminine.”","Khan's debut single, ""The Wizard"", was released digitally through Drowned in Sound records and on 7"" vinyl through Khan's own imprint, She Bear Records. In 2006, she signed to Echo, a record label owned by independent publisher Chrysalis Music that acted as an incubator for artists before ""upstreaming"" them to major labels. Echo released her debut album, Fur and Gold, in September 2006. In 2007, Bat for Lashes and Echo signed an international licensing deal with Parlophone Records, which re-released Fur and Gold the same year. A limited vinyl version was released by Los Angeles indie label Manimal Vinyl in May 2007. Fur and Gold reached number forty-eight on the UK Albums Chart and has since been certified gold by the BPI for sales exceeding 100,000 copies. In 2007, Khan appeared at the Glastonbury Festival and toured the United States.

Fur and Gold received critical acclaim, including a five-star review from The Guardian. It was shortlisted for the 2007 Mercury Prize, losing out to Klaxons' Myths of the Near Future, despite being a favourite of British media to win the award. Also in 2007, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) bestowed their Vanguard Award on her and chose her to perform at their ""ASCAP Presents..."" showcase at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas. In 2008, Khan was nominated for British Breakthrough Act and British Female Solo Artist at the Brit Awards.

Radiohead's 2008 tour featured several shows with Bat for Lashes as their opening act. Her version of The Cure's ""A Forest"" appeared on a charity album called Perfect as Cats on Manimal Vinyl in late 2008.Khan's second album, Two Suns, was released in April 2009 and produced by Khan and David Kosten. In preparation for the album, Khan journeyed to Joshua Tree Desert in California to gain inspiration, before returning to New York and London to write and record the finished material for release.

A concept album, Two Suns focuses on Khan's desert-born alter ego Pearl, whose personality she adopted while staying in New York to gain a better understanding of the character. She revealed to the BBC's Newsbeat, ""I really just did it as an experiment of dressing up myself with quite garish extreme feminine make-up. I wanted to photograph myself in that situation and just see what it made me feel."" Khan believed that living in Brooklyn when bands such as TV on the Radio, MGMT, and Gang Gang Dance were emerging on the music scene had an influence on the album's musical style. In an interview with MTV, she said, ""I experienced that whole thing coming out, in terms of beats and like going out dancing and checking out all this new music, it was really inspiring."" During the album's production, she also collaborated with Brooklyn band Yeasayer for the bass and beat programming. In June 2009, Bat for Lashes first appeared on the cover of The Fader, in its 60th issue.

Two Suns debuted at number five on the UK Albums Chart, and has been certified gold by the BPI for sales of 100,000 copies. The first single from the album, ""Daniel"", became Khan's first hit, peaking at number thirty-six on the UK Singles Chart; it later won the Ivor Novello Award for Best Contemporary Song and was nominated for the MTV Video Music Award for Breakthrough Video of the Year. The following singles were ""Pearl's Dream"" and a double A-side of ""Sleep Alone"" and ""Moon and Moon"", the latter of which was featured in a high-profile advertising campaign for children's charity Barnardo's in late 2009.



Critical response to the album was mostly favourable, generating a score of 77 on the review aggregator Metacritic. In their review for Two Suns, NME awarded it 8 out of 10, describing the album as ""epic in scope and ambition and requires a similarly epic patience to unravel its charms."" Rolling Stone also rated it favourably, stating ""Khan proves she's a powerhouse under her billowy sleeves. She could be the next Kate Bush."" However, some critics such as PopMatters found problems: reviewing the album, they wrote, ""While the weaker songs are definitely not throwaways, they miss the mark in more than one way."" Blender magazine also felt the album was average, awarding it 3 out 5 stars, saying, ""The contrast between Pearl and Natasha isn't always crisply drawn"". As with Fur and Gold, Khan was nominated for the Mercury Prize for Two Suns. In 2010, she won Best Alternative Act at the UK Asian Music Awards and received a second BRIT Award nomination for British Female Solo Artist.

As part of the 2009 summer festival season, Khan played at Glastonbury, Somerset House, and the iTunes Festival.

The special edition, which included a cover version of the Kings of Leon single ""Use Somebody"", was released simultaneously in the United States. Later in 2009, the cover artwork for Two Suns was nominated for Best Art Vinyl.

In early 2010, Khan toured South America supporting Coldplay after a gig at The De La Warr Pavilion, including playing covers of Radiohead's ""All I Need"" and The Cure's ""Lullaby"". In 2010, she collaborated with Beck on the track ""Let's Get Lost"" for the Twilight Saga: Eclipse soundtrack, and contributed the song ""Sleep Alone"" from Two Suns to the Enough Project and Downtown Records' Raise Hope for Congo compilation. Proceeds from the compilation funded efforts to make the protection and empowerment of Congo's women a priority, as well as to inspire individuals around the world to raise their voice for peace in Congo.

For Record Store Day 2010, Bat for Lashes released an exclusive double A-side 7"" single comprising a live performance of the ""Trophy"" single B-side ""Howl"", recorded at De La Warr Pavilion, and a cover of ""Wild Is the Wind"", originally written by Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington.

The lead single, ""Laura"", was released in July; the second single, ""All Your Gold"", came out in September.

Subsequent singles were ""A Wall"" and ""Lilies"". Khan attended the 2013 Brit Awards, having been nominated in the Best British Female category, and was also nominated at the Ivor Novello Awards in the category of Best Song Musically and Lyrically (for ""Laura"").

In 2013, Khan performed at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, supported Blur at the Irish Museum of Modern Art in Dublin, Ireland, and opened for Depeche Mode on the first half of their North American tour. In June, she released a cover of ""The Bride"", a pre-revolution Iranian song, with the rock band Toy. On 2 September 2013, Khan premiered the track ""Garden's Heart"", a collaboration with Jon Hopkins for the soundtrack to the film How I Live Now.

In 2014, Khan collaborated with Damon Albarn on a track for his 2014 solo album Everyday Robots, premiered ""Skin Song"" from Body of Songs&mdash;a compilation album featuring songs inspired by anatomy and medical science&mdash;and contributed a cover of ""Plan the Escape"" by Son Lux to the soundtrack album of the film The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1.On 15 August 2015, Khan began previewing new music on her Twitter and Instagram pages via a game of Hangman.

Victoria Beckham,"Beckham was born at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, Essex, United Kingdom, and raised in Goffs Oak, Hertfordshire. She is the eldest of three children of Jacqueline Doreen (née Cannon), a former insurance clerk and hairdresser, and Anthony William Adams, who worked as an electronics engineer. They founded an electronics wholesale business which allowed a comfortable upbringing for Victoria, her sister, Louise, and her brother, Christian Adams. Beckham's great-great-great-grandfather was German artist and revolutionary Carl Heinrich Pfänder and her great-great granduncle was Minnesota politician William Pfaender.

After watching the musical film Fame in 1980, she decided to pursue a musical career. Jacqueline and Anthony Adams enrolled her at Jason Theatre School. In 1991, Beckham entered Laine Theatre Arts in Epsom, Surrey and studied dance and modelling. Beckham attended St. Mary's High School in Cheshunt, where she was embarrassed by her family's wealth and often begged her father not to drop her off outside the school in their Rolls Royce. Eventually, she became a member of a band called Persuasion.","Beckham auditioned for a March 1994 advertisement in The Stage which required girls who were ""street smart, extrovert[ed], ambitious and able to sing and dance"". In 1994, Beckham joined the all-female group, the Spice Girls. In the recordings before her marriage, she is credited with her maiden name as Victoria Adams. The group's first single was called ""Wannabe"" (1996), and she worked alongside Geri Halliwell, Emma Bunton, Melanie Brown and Melanie Chisholm. It went to number one in the United Kingdom and United States, and another 35 countries. It was followed by eight further number one singles from their albums Spice, Spiceworld and Forever. Each member of the group received a nickname from the media and Beckham was named ""Posh Spice"". The group is the best-selling female group of all time, selling over 80 million records worldwide. After the release of their third album, Forever, which charted at number two in the UK but was far less successful than their previous two albums, the Spice Girls stopped recording, concentrating on their solo careers in regards to their foreseeable future.On 14 August 2000, Beckham released her first solo single, ""Out of Your Mind"" in collaboration with Dane Bowers and Truesteppers. The week of release coincided with the release of ""Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)"" by Spiller featuring Sophie Ellis-Bextor, resulting in a chart battle dubbed 'Posh vs. Posher' by the tabloids. Before the single's release, on 8 July 2000, Beckham made her public solo debut at London's Hyde Park at a concert to raise money for the Prince's Trust charity. She sang ""Out of Your Mind"" to a 100,000-strong audience. Beckham then signed a recording contract with her group label Virgin Records. Her next single as a solo artist, ""Not Such An Innocent Girl"", was released on 17 September 2001. Again, she faced competition in another hugely hyped chart battle, this time with Kylie Minogue's single ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"". Despite a huge promotional campaign, Beckham was outsold eight to one, and her single debuted at number 6. Beckham's eponymous debut album, which was released on 1 October 2001, reached Number 10 in the UK album chart. The album cost a reputed £5 million to produce and it sold a modest 50,000 copies.

The second and final single to be released from the album was ""A Mind of Its Own"" on 11 February 2002. The single reached number 6 in the UK and sold 56,500 copies. Rumours soon spread that Beckham was to be dropped by her label for not charting in the Top Three. These were strongly refuted at the time. Beckham commented ""You know what newspapers are like, they just like to put all the negative stuff in, but as far as I'm concerned and the record company is concerned it is all great."" A third single, ""I Wish"", was promoted but never materialised. The single version was a remix featuring Robbie Craig, and was performed on TV on Friday Night's All Wright. Following the announcement of Beckham's second pregnancy, the single was shelved. Beckham was reportedly dropped by Virgin Records along with fellow Spice Girls Emma Bunton and Melanie B,; but a statement from her publicist denied reports, stating: ""No-one has been dropped. The Virgin deal has come to a natural end and both parties have decided not to continue.""In 2002, Beckham signed a contract with Telstar Records and 19 Management worth £1.5 million. In 2003, she began recording an electropop-influenced album, Open Your Eyes and chose ""Let Your Head Go"" as first single. When the album was finalized, Beckham was disappointed with the result and decided to return to the studio to record a new material. She wanted a more urban sound and worked with the producer Damon Dash to work on the R&B and hip hop influenced album Come Together. When Dash was first asked why he recorded with Beckham, he stated: ""Because I see how much she gets photographed over here."" A Dash-produced track ""It's That Simple"" featuring M.O.P. premiered on radio stations in July 2003 as promotional single, generating mixed reviews. Beckham's first single with Telstar, the double A-side ""Let Your Head Go"" / ""This Groove"", was released in the UK on 29 December 2003, following heavy promotion and many TV appearances across the Christmas period with the video being directed by Andy Hylton. The single charted at number three in the UK.

The double A-side was a thermometer to Beckham – if ""Let Your Head Go"" was more successful, she would release the electropop-inspired album Open Your Eyes, but if ""This Groove"" was better rated, she would release the R&B album Come Together. Outside of the UK, Damon Dash had plans for her in the US, including a potential release of ""This Groove"", and believed that Beckham would be successful because R&B was up in the world and her music style was similar to Jennifer Lopez. With the financial problems of the record company, combined with a rumoured fall-out between Dash and Fuller and the UK media massacring Beckham's solo career, the release of any album was postponed. Beckham's final plan at a solo career was the announcement of a new single, ""My Love Is for Real"", slated for a Summer 2004 release. But in April 2004, Telstar announced bankruptcy and Beckham gave up music to focus on her fashion career.In 2007, the Spice Girls reformed and announced plans to embark upon a reunion tour, from which they were said to have earned £10 million each (approximately $20 million). Beckham had previously stated that she and her former Spice colleagues were enjoying their solo careers in various fields, saying ""We're all still doing our own thing."" Their Greatest Hits album was released in early November 2007 and the tour began on 2 December 2007. At its advent, Beckham said ""I wanted my children to see that Mummy was a pop star. It was the last opportunity for them to stand in a crowd full of people screaming for the Spice Girls."" When Beckham had her hair coloured brown for the tour, she stated that her sons immediately reacted by saying ""Oh my goodness, it's Posh Spice. She's back."" She was the only member of the group not to sing a solo song on the tour, instead posing in the style of a fashion show on a makeshift catwalk, whereas the others each performed a number from their solo careers.

Film-maker Bob Smeaton directed an official film of the tour titled Spice Girls: Giving You Everything, which was first aired on Fox8 in Australia. It later aired in the UK on 31 December 2007 on BBC One. As well as their sell-out tour, the Spice Girls were contracted to appear in Tesco advertisements, for which they were paid £1 million each.

In October 2009, reports suggested that the Spice Girls were to star in a reality show in which they would cast female actors to play their roles in a musical. The following year, Judy Craymer teamed up with the Spice Girls and Simon Fuller to start developing a Spice Girls musical titled Viva Forever!. On 26 June 2012, all five Spice Girls were in attendance at a press conference in London to promote the launch of Viva Forever! The musical opened at the West End's Piccadilly Theatre on 11 December 2012. On 12 August 2012, after much speculation, Beckham and the Spice Girls performed a medley of ""Wannabe"" and ""Spice Up Your Life"" at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony, reuniting solely for the event. Their performance was the most tweeted moment of Olympics closing ceremony with over 116,000 tweets on Twitter per minute.

The band reunited again for a 2019 tour, however Beckham opted not to participate in the reunion choosing to focus on her fashion label instead. When the American television presenter Ellen DeGeneres asked her why she chose not to join with the other Spice Girls for the reunion tour, she said ""It just didn't feel like the right thing to do. [But] I'll always be Posh Spice, always.""","

Natasha Bedingfield,"When Bedingfield was a teenager, she and her siblings, Daniel and Nikola, formed the dance/electronic group, The DNA Algorithm. The group provided Bedingfield with the opportunity to explore different musical genres and expand her songwriting abilities. She provided vocals for the group which primarily performed dance-pop music about independence and empowerment, themes that would later be found in her own solo compositions. At age 14, Bedingfield sang vocals on Origins Refined Intricacy (Steelyard Records).

Bedingfield attended a year at the University of Greenwich, where she studied psychology, then left to concentrate on singing and songwriting. At first, she recorded demos in the garages of friends who had recording studios, which she presented to record companies. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Bedingfield composed and recorded songs for the Hillsong London Church. In 2004, her recordings appeared on the church's live album Shout God's Fame and the children's album Jesus Is My Superhero by Hillsong Music Australia.","Bedingfield was introduced to Phonogenic founder and A&R Paul Lisberg by the artist's manager Gary Wilson. Lisberg was initially hesitant, later telling HitQuarters: ""[They] were good but weren't right for us ... "" However, it was when, at a meeting together, Lisberg heard her singing ability and creative vocal ad-libbing first-hand that he became excited by Bedingfield's potential. Label interest was later confirmed when a trial studio session together with writers Steve Kipner and Andrew Frampton produced songs that were in keeping with Lisberg's vision for Phonogenic. Bedingfield signed a recording contract with BMG UK & Ireland, through its imprint Phonogenic Records, in July 2003.

Her debut studio album Unwritten was released in September 2004 and featured collaborations with Steve Kipner, Danielle Brisebois, Nick Lachey, James Reilly, Andrew Frampton, Wayne Wilkins, Kara DioGuardi, Guy Chambers, Patrick Leonard and the rapper Bizarre. The album contained uptempo pop-rock songs and influences from R&B music. Bedingfield's lyrics focused on independence, opportunism and female empowerment. Reviews of the album were generally positive, and it was described as a ""well-made pop album for the new millennium"" by Allmusic. The album debuted on the UK Albums Chart at number one and reached the top thirty in the U.S. It sold well, reaching multi-platinum status in the UK and Gold status in the U.S. The first single released from the album was ""Single"", which reached number three on the UK Singles Chart.

The song became Bedingfield's first UK number one and US top twenty single. ""Unwritten"" was released as the album's third single in 2004, the song reached number six on the UK Singles Chart and it also became the most played song on US radio in 2006. ""I Bruise Easily"" was released as the album's fourth single, it did not perform as well as its predecessors but was still a moderate success, reaching number twelve on the UK Singles Chart.

""Soulmate"" was released as the album's second single on 2 July 2007 and also peaked at number seven in the UK. To promote N.B., Bedingfield embarked on the FutureSex/LoveShow tour in May 2007.

On 1 July 2007, Bedingfield performed ""Unwritten"" at the Concert for Diana held at Wembley Stadium, London, an event which celebrated the life of Princess Diana almost ten years after her death.

The title track was released as the second single in February 2008 and peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100. On 18 January 2008, Bedingfield's UK tour was cancelled for the second time, one month before it was supposed to start, so she could spend more time promoting her album in the U.S. In August 2008, Bedingfield and other singers including Beyoncé, Rihanna, Melissa Etheridge, Carrie Underwood, Miley Cyrus, Leona Lewis and Mariah Carey recorded the charity single, ""Just Stand Up"" produced by Babyface and L.A. Reid, to support ""Stand Up to Cancer"". On 5 September 2008, the singers performed it live on TV.Bedingfield stated on her blog that she would start work on her new album in early 2009.

I love coming here as often as I can, usually once a year to fuel up on ideas for my next album"". She also confirmed she was working with Brian Kennedy, who produced/co-wrote Rihanna's hit single ""Disturbia"" and was writing songs with him while on tour to have the album released by the end of 2009.

The album was said to feature production from RedOne, Dr. Luke, Benny Blanco, Paul Williams and Marshall Altman.

On 13 May 2013, she appeared as a guest judge on the New Zealand version of The X Factor alongside her brother Daniel Bedingfield.

Lauren Bennett,N/A,"Bennett was part of a girl group called the Paradiso Girls. The group consisted of seven members at their formation in 2007, but had dropped to five by 2008. Each member comes from a different country: Chelsea Korka from the United States, Aria Crescendo from France, Kelly Beckett from Barbados, Shar Mae Amor from the Philippines, and Bennett from England. The band was signed to Interscope Records. Their debut single, ""Patron Tequila"", featuring Lil Jon and Eve, was released on 12 May 2009 and reached No. 3 on the Hot Dance Club Play Chart and No. 82 on the Canadian Hot 100. After their second single, ""Who's My Bitch"", was unsuccessful, the group disbanded in 2010.Bennett went on to pursue a solo career. She was featured in a remix of will.i.am's ""I Got It from My Mama"". She also joined in the Party Rock Tour with LMFAO. Later that year, she met CeeLo Green and was featured on his album The Lady Killer on the song ""Love Gun"". The following year, she was featured on LMFAO's international hit ""Party Rock Anthem"", which sold over 5,000,000 digital downloads in the United States and reached No. 1 in the United States for six weeks, becoming Bennett's first number one single on the US Billboard Hot 100. Bennett often works with Robin Antin and is featured in the Pussycat Dolls' second fitness DVD. Her debut solo single ""I Wish I Wish"" was released on 21 November 2011 via Interscope Records. The track was written by Esmée Denters, Billy Mann and produced by David Schuler.While talking to Billboard.com on the red carpet at the American Music Awards, Bennett confirmed herself as a part of the newly regrouped recording group. This made her the first member of a brand new line-up that creator Robin Antin confirmed to Billboard was in the process of being built. ""We're currently figuring out who's in the group and we're working on an album,"" Bennett says of the new group, which at the time was slated to be the revamped Pussycat Dolls. In 2011 it was announced that a new line-up of the ""sexy brand"" would debut in February 2012 during a GoDaddy Super Bowl commercial. Bennett was featured and included in the original line-up along with Paula van Oppen and three others who were cut from the group for various reasons. Eventually, Simone Battle, Emmalyn Estrada, and Natasha Slayton joined and G.R.L. debuted their hit single ""Vacation"" on The Smurfs 2 soundtrack.

G.R.L. found international success and was featured with artists such as Pitbull on his hit single ""Wild Wild Love"". The group went on to release a self-titled EP, G.R.L., in which its lead single Ugly Heart peaked at 2 on the Australian charts. G.R.L. were on their way to mainstream success when group member Simone Battle died in September 2014. In January 2015, the group released a single in honor of Battle titled ""Lighthouse"", and dedicated themselves to raising awareness for mental health issues. On 2 June 2015, the group officially disbanded.On 8 April 2016, a dance track featuring Bennett and produced by Greek DJ Nick Martin titled ""Reality"" was released.

On 8 May 2016, Bennett announced and released her new single ""Hurricane"" via her Instagram, adding ""After G.R.L. ended I had no idea what was going to happen next, everything fell apart pretty fast. That's when this song was written. After seeing my mother suffer with mental struggles for years I then lost a friend to this. It has always affected my life in some way. We all at least know someone who has dealt with it or have yourself. This is a story to show from my eyes what it feels like to suffer from this but also the other perspective to lose someone to this."" It was later announced on Twitter that a portion of the proceeds from the single would be donated to The Campaign to Change Direction, an organization dedicated to change the culture of mental health in America.

On 15 June 2016, over a year after G.R.L. announced their breakup, it was reported that the group has plans to reform under new representation with UK based agency Loco Talent. In June, the group's new agent, Matt Wynter, stated that the G.R.L. is back via Loco Talent's website. Bennett is one of the two original members returning under the new lineup.

She made her first demo under the name Ladybird but soon decided to use her real name. After winning the Creajoven contest for local singer songwriters in Murcia she started doing her first solo shows. In 2006, her demo was voted as one of the best of the year in the Radio 3 (Spanish national public radio) show, 'Disco Grande'. Right after, she began writing the songs that would eventually form Ashfield Avenue, Alondra's debut album. The title comes from the name of the street where she was born in Lancaster.

Miki Berenyi,"Berenyi was born in Chelsea, London to a Japanese mother, actress Yasuko Nagazumi, and Hungarian father, Ivan Berenyi.

At the age of 14, Berenyi met friend and future bandmate Emma Anderson while both were students at Queen's College. They became interested in music and together published a music fanzine, Alphabet Soup (which lasted for five issues). Berenyi first played bass with the band the Bugs. In 1987, Berenyi studied English literature at North London Polytechnic, where she met drummer Chris Acland and singer Meriel Barham. Along with Anderson, they decided to form their own band, originally called the Baby Machines. Bassist Steve Rippon joined and they changed their name to Lush. When Barham left, ""the remaining members of Lush placed ads in local papers looking for Barham's replacement, but they couldn't find the singer they wanted and Berenyi took over the vocals"". From 1987 until 1996, she played with Lush, releasing several albums, singles and music videos and toured extensively through the UK, North America, Japan, Australia and other countries. She and Acland also collaborated with members of Cocteau Twins and Moose, releasing one song in 1991 under the name Lillies.

Lush officially announced their breakup in February 1998, following Acland's suicide in October 1996.

After Lush split, Berenyi appeared on the Rentals' album Seven More Minutes (1999). She also contributed vocals to a remix of a Flat 7 track by Robin Guthrie (who also produced Lush's early work) and appeared on Seinking Ships' debut album, Museum Quality Capture, released in 2010.

When asked if she missed anything about her time in Lush, Berenyi stated, ""I miss the excitement and energy of playing live and the camaraderie of touring—being with the band and crew in a foreign country is like going on holiday with your mates but even more fun because it’s free."" She also said, ""I enjoyed being in the band immensely, I’m glad I did it"".

Berenyi later worked for a magazine as a sub-editor and did not perform for many years. She explained: ""I was never a proper guitarist—only in the context of Lush. I played the guitar to write songs on and to play live"".

Lush, including Berenyi, announced a reunion on 28 September 2015. They toured extensively throughout 2016 and released an EP of new material; ""Blind Spot"" in April of that year. Bassist Phil King left the band in October 2016 and as a consequence Lush played their final farewell gig, with Michael Conroy of Modern English on bass at Manchester Academy on 25 November 2016.

In September 2018, Berenyi announced that she had formed a new band, Piroshka, with Welch, Conroy and former Moose member K.J. ""Moose"" McKillop. Berenyi and partner McKillop have two children.

Emily Bergl,"Bergl was born in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England, to an Irish mother and an English architect father. She has one brother. Bergl's family relocated to the United States when she was six, initially residing in Denver, Colorado. When she was ten, the family then relocated to Glenview, Illinois, where she spent the remainder of her upbringing. She attended Glenbrook South High School and Grinnell College, where she was the lead in several school productions. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1997 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and theatre. During her college years, she spent a semester (spring 1996) studying with the National Theater Institute at The Eugene O'Neill Theater Center. She received additional acting training at HB Studio in New York City.","Bergl began acting in theater, appearing in a production of Romeo and Juliet opposite Neil Patrick Harris at San Diego's Old Globe Theatre in 1998. She then had the lead role of Rachel Lang in the 1999 film, The Rage: Carrie 2, the sequel to the 1976 supernatural thriller Carrie. Bergl has appeared in episodes of the TV shows Gilmore Girls, CSI: Miami, Medium, Law & Order: Criminal Intent, NYPD Blue, and Star Trek: Enterprise. She also appeared in the psychological thriller Chasing Sleep, opposite star Jeff Daniels. Bergl had a major role in the Steven Spielberg 2002 miniseries Taken.

Bergl had a significant co-starring role in the ABC series Men in Trees as Annie, an enthusiastic fan of the series' main character, relationship expert Marin Frist (Anne Heche). Annie travels to every event Marin appears at, and ends up in Elmo, Alaska with Marin. Annie stays in Elmo (as does Marin after she decides to re-evaluate her life), when she meets Patrick Bachelor (Derek Richardson), a local hotel desk clerk and radio DJ she knew through online chats about Marin's books.

Bergl played in Becky Shaw at Second Stage Theatre in New York in the beginning of 2009. Bergl played Paul Young's new wife, Beth, in the seventh season of Desperate Housewives.In 2010–11, Bergl performed a cabaret show called Kidding on the Square, which had a run in the summer of 2010 in Los Angeles and New York City, then later in Chicago. In September 2011, with the show in New York, The New York Times wrote of her performance:

""Emily Bergl, an incandescent kewpie doll with a bright Betty Boop-inflected chirp, a defiant flounce and a sharp comedic edge, took the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel by storm on Tuesday evening. Her sensational show, ""Kidding on the Square"" may have played elsewhere, but arriving at the staid Oak Room it felt like a gust of fresh air that could knock you off your feet.""

Jade Bird,"Jade Elizabeth Bird was born in Hexham, Northumberland. Bird and her family moved to London when she was two years old, and lived on a military base in Germany when she was five. She later moved to Bridgend, South Wales, with her mother, after the divorce of her parents, which occurred when Bird was seven or eight. It was during this time in Wales, living with her mother and grandmother (who had also been through a divorce), that Bird began to write songs. At age 16, Bird began attending the BRIT School in Croydon, which she graduated from in 2016. While at the BRIT School, she performed at concerts several times a week.","While in her final year at BRIT School, Bird recorded a demo of 13 tracks in her friend's bathroom, which would later bring her a management deal. Soon after the management deal, she signed to Glassnote Records. In 2017, she was sent to tour the United States with Brent Cobb. She played a showcase event at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas in March 2017 and later in the year she opened for First Aid Kit, Son Little and London Grammar. In 2017, Bird won the ANCHOR 2017 award of the Reeperbahn Festival in Hamburg.

Also in 2017, Bird recorded her debut extended play (EP), Something American, in Rhinebeck, Boiceville and Palenville, all in New York. It was produced by Simon Felice, of The Felice Brothers and David Baron, and featured guitarist Will Rees, drummer Matt Johnson and guitarist Larry Campbell, and was released that same year. The EP received a positive reception from a number of critics. Stephanie Penman commented that the songs were ""musical masterpieces"" and Amanda Erwin stated ""[it’s] no surprise Bird has found a concrete voice of her own so quickly, unafraid to bare her raw emotions on each track."" The Line of Best Fit called the EP ""a vibrant collection of folk and country-tinged songs"". She finished 2017 by appearing as a finalist for the BBC Sound Of award for 2018.

A year after releasing her debut EP, she released her debut single ""Lottery"", a punk-influenced song with romantic lyrical themes. The song went to the top of the Adult Alternative Songs and remained there for three weeks. This made her only the fifth female solo artist to top that chart since 2010. On 31 July 2018, Bird released her second single from what would be her debut studio album. The song, entitled ""Uh Huh"", was accompanied by a video directed by Kate Moross. Atwood Magazine noted some lyrical similarities with the previous single ""Lottery"" but also mentioned that the song demonstrated hard rock influences throughout. In November, she released another single from the album, ""Love Has All Been Done Before"", and finished off the year with a tour of the UK and Republic of Ireland.After announcing the release date for her upcoming album, Bird released ""I Get No Joy"", the fourth single from that album. The upbeat rock song was described by Bird as being influenced by ""the stream of thought that runs through your head at all times as an overthinker"". It was accompanied by a music video, directed by Jamie Thraves. Her debut was recorded at Clubhouse Studios in Rhinebeck, NY, Sun Mountain Studios in Boiceville, NY, and Barn Studio in Palenville, NY. Simone Felice and David Baron producing. David Baron and Peter Hanlon engineering. David Baron and Mark “Spike” Stent mixing. In preparation for its release, Bird toured with Irish singer-songwriter Hozier, playing in venues such as the Mahaffey Theater, The Fillmore and Ovens Auditorium, gaining positive attention from American music critics. On 19 April 2019, she released her debut album, Jade Bird. The album received a Metacritic score of 75 based on 14 reviews, indicating generally favourable reviews from several major publications. NME called the entire album ""a triumph"" while Clash led with labelling Jade Bird as ""[an] assured debut from a force to be reckoned with"". A review in Paste was slightly more critical of the album, ""Jade Bird is an album of loose change, a pocketful of shiny, well-written nuggets that might give off a lot of flash individually but when put together don't equal the sum of their parts."" The release of the album was followed by a nomination for Emerging Act Of The Year in the 2019 Americana Music Honors & Awards. On 24 July, it was announced that Bird had been nominated for three awards at the AIM Independent Music Awards. Only Idles were nominated for more awards at this event. She ended up winning the award for International Breakthrough artist.Nine months after releasing her debut album, the follow-up album was written and completed while Bird was in New York. Following the cancellation of her 2020 tour, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Bird collaborated with Microsoft and was the first artist to take part in their RE:Surface project, a virtual live-streamed concert, on 29 May 2020. Months later, in October, she then headlined another live-streamed concert. This one was called Come Together Mental Health Music Festival and was for the benefit of the National Alliance on Mental Illness. On 4 November, Bird released ""Headstart"", the first single from her second studio album. The song, produced by Dave Cobb, is an indie song about an infatuation that is not returned. This was followed up by ""Houdini"" on 26 November, a song based on the disappearance of someone from her life. Bird's first release of 2021 was the single ""Open Up The Heavens"", from her upcoming second studio album. This song, which ABC Online described as ""one of Bird's finest pieces yet"", was the last to be recorded for that album. On 16 April, Bird released her second EP, RCA Studio A Sessions. Her second album, Different Kinds of Light, was announced on 20 May and released on 13 August. The album, produced by Dave Cobb, was written in Japan, Mexico, Nashville and New York and contains inspiration from Bird's own life experiences as well as fictional characters from her imagination.","Title—Details—UK—UK Indie—UK Americana—SCO—SWI—US Folk—US Heat.,Jade Bird—* Released: 19 April 2019 * Label: Glassnote * Format: Digital download, streaming, CD, vinyl—10—2—1—10—91—14—1,Different Kinds of Light—* Released: 13 August 2021 * Label: Glassnote * Formats: Digital download, streaming, CD, vinyl—27—9,Something American—* Released: 7 July 2017 * Label: Glassnote Records * Format: Digital download, CD, vinyl,RCA Studio A Sessions—* Released: 16 April 2021 * Label: Glassnote Records * Format: Digital download,Title—Year—US AAA—US Adult—US Alt—Album,""Lottery""—2018—1—34—Jade Bird,""Furious""—2018—Non-album single,""Uh Huh""—2018—3—38—Jade Bird,""Love Has All Been Done Before""—2018—Jade Bird,""I Get No Joy""—2019—12—Jade Bird,""My Motto""—2019—Jade Bird,""Headstart""—2020—5—Different Kinds of Light,""Houdini""—2020—Different Kinds of Light,""Open up the Heavens""—2021—19—Different Kinds of Light,""Different Kinds of Light""—2021—Different Kinds of Light,""Now is the Time""—2021—27—Different Kinds of Light,""—"" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.,""Don't Stop""—2018—Vanity Fair,","2017—ANCHOR—N/A—Herself—Won,2017—BBC—Sound of 2018—Herself—Included,2017—Ticketweb—Ones To Watch 2018—Herself—Included,2018—Radio X—Best Songs Of 2018—""Love Has All Been Done Before""—Included,2018—Radio X—Great X-Pectations 2019—Herself—Included,2019—MTV Push—Ones To Watch 2019—Herself—Nominated,2019—Radio X—Best of British 2019—""Uh-Huh""—#84,2019—Americana Music Honors & Awards—Emerging Act of the Year—Herself—Nominated,2019—AIM Independent Music Awards—Best Independent Album—Jade Bird—Nominated,2019—AIM Independent Music Awards—UK Independent Breakthrough—Herself—Nominated,2019—AIM Independent Music Awards—International Breakthrough—Herself—Won,2020—NME Awards—Best New Act in the World—Herself—Nominated,2020—NME Awards—Best New British Act—Herself—Nominated,",English singer (born 1997),1/9/1997,2015–present,"Americana

She won both the under-18s category and the Grand Prize, against 10,000 other competitors. She performed her own song, called ""So Be Free"", at the competition in front of 2,000 people.

In 2009, Birdy performed live on piano for BBC Radio 3's Pianothon in London. In January 2011, at the age of 14, Birdy released a cover version of Bon Iver's song ""Skinny Love"". The song became her first hit on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at 17. The single was chosen as ""Record of the Week"" by UK radio DJ Fearne Cotton, resulting in it being added to BBC Radio 1's B‑list playlist as soon as it was released in March 2011. The official music video for the song was directed by Sophie Muller. The song was also featured on The Vampire Diaries episode ""The Sun Also Rises"", which aired on 5 May 2011. ""Skinny Love"" peaked at number 1 in the Netherlands.

The first official single, ""Wings"", was released on 22 July 2013 and a second song, ""All You Never Say"", was sent to subscribers of Birdy's mailing list and posted on YouTube on 15 August 2013. The song ""Wings"" was also featured on The Vampire Diaries episode ""Home"", which aired on 15 May 2014 (her eighteenth birthday). The album was released in the UK and other surrounding countries on 23 September 2013 and received mostly positive reviews. In North America, the album was released on 3 June 2014. A subsequent EP entitled Breathe was released on 24 September.

Birdy did tours of America and Australia in 2013. After her concert in the Palais Theatre in Melbourne, Australia, a reviewer described her as a sensational pianist who appears to be shy and timid, but whose voice ""rings throughout the theatre."" The only criticism was that what was ""severely lacking"" was any sense of crowd interaction. The tour also included appearances on TV shows like Sunrise, on which she sang ""Wings."" While in Melbourne, Birdy also sang ""Skinny Love"" at the Logie Awards in April 2013.

In September 2013, Birdy covered a song entitled ""Let Her Go"" by Passenger, live on BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge. This track features on the BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge 2013 album.

Birdy's song ""Wings,"" from her second album, was used as the soundtrack to the Lloyds Bank 250-year anniversary Horse Story advertisements in June 2015.

In August 2015, Birdy co-wrote ""Let It All Go"" with Rhodes. The single was released on 11 September 2015 via digital download in the UK. In October 2015, Birdy performed a cover of Firestone, originally by Kygo ft. Conrad Sewell on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge. This track featured on the BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge 2015 album.In January 2016, Birdy released ""Keeping Your Head Up"", the first single from her third album, Beautiful Lies, which she had started writing material for in 2014 while touring in America. ""Beautiful Lies"", the second single from the album was released in February. ""Wild Horses"", the third single from the album was released in March. The album itself was released on 25 March 2016. On 20 April 2016, the Japanese Edition of Beautiful Lies was released, containing a bonus track entitled ""Lights"".

Speaking about Beautiful Lies, Birdy later said this album was what she was most proud of. She added: ""The album is about growing up and not accepting change. It's about not really wanting to grow up; it's about lying to yourself. I'd missed a lot of growing up with my family so it's about that. It's also inspired by 'Memories of a Geisha' so it has an Asian feel to it and it's about feeling a much stronger person.""

On 1 April 2016, Birdy performed a cover of 'Adventure of a Lifetime' originally by Coldplay for 3FM. On 16 April 2016, Birdy released a limited edition vinyl for Record Store Day of the songs 'Lost It All' and 'Take You Everywhere I Go'. On 25 April 2016, Birdy performed a cover of ""Fast Car"" by Tracy Chapman for BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge, and on 27 April she performed a cover of ""Sorry"" by Justin Bieber at SiriusXM Studios.

On 8 May 2016, Birdy performed 'Wild Horses' at the opening ceremony of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) awards night, at the Royal Festival Hall in London. She was also the face of the REDValentino spring/summer campaign for 2016 and 2017.

In June 2016, Birdy released three digital albums without publicity. The albums consisted entirely of instrumental works featuring her on the piano, and were called ""Ornithology,"" ""Vogelfrei"" and ""Nightbird."" In April 2018, she uploaded these albums to her YouTube channel in a collaboration with Believe SAS, a French company that distributes digital music for independent labels and artists.

On 23 September 2016, ""Beautiful Birds"" was released by Passenger, featuring Birdy. On 4 November 2016, ""Find Me"" was released by Sigma, featuring Birdy. The song peaked at number 36 on the UK Singles Chart and number one on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart in its 20 May 2017 issue.

Birdy undertook extensive touring after the release of Beautiful Lies, including a tour of the United States and an Asian tour from Japan to Singapore. By this time, her band had grown from four to five, with an almost completely new lineup. The band members were: Charlotte Hatherley (guitar), Joel Grainger (violin), Richard Evans (bass), Jay Sikora (drums) and Hazel Mills (keyboards). She has said she found Asia like another planet, ""such a different world."" The audiences were very reserved and quiet, there would be a huge gap after each song, then they would start clapping; it made her wonder if they liked her. She said they don't really clap that much, then after the show they were going crazy and screaming. She found it ""really strange.""

In an interview with Interview magazine, on 22 March 2016, Birdy explained how she had always had ideas but was never confident enough to assert them. With 'Beautiful Lies', she felt that she was a lot stronger and everything felt better. Birdy stated that where she had gone wrong with her second album had been that she had compromised too much, allowing others to influence her too much. In contrast, with 'Beautiful Lies' she had been 'really bossy'. In conclusion, she added that she loves writing for film and would love to do more of it; it was a 'really natural' progression for her work.

Birdy was featured on the cover of Wonderland magazine in the Autumn 2016 issue, with an accompanying shoot and interview. Speaking to the magazine, Birdy explained that her mother was a concert pianist and a lot of her family were very musical. Her mother would play classical music and her father would play ""poppier records"" like Tracy Chapman and The Beatles. It was a real mix of genres, she told the magazine.

Birdy performed two songs at the BFI Luminous fundraising gala on 3 October 2017. Interviewed at the function, she said she was writing material for her new album, but it was still in the early stages.

In December 2017, Variety.com reported that Warner/Chappell Music, the publishing arm of Warner Music Group, had signed Birdy to a global publishing deal. Mike Smith, Warner/Chappell UK managing director, said that Birdy was an incredible talent, there was a lot more to come from her and he looked forward to working with her in the years ahead.

After taking a break from music, Birdy released a new single, ""Open Your Heart"" on 4 September 2020. This was soon after accompanied with the announcement of a new EP, Piano Sketches, to be released on 6 November 2020. It features four tracks, primarily piano based.

On 22 January 2021, Birdy announced her fourth album, Young Heart, via her social media. It was released on 30 April and features 16 tracks. On the same day as the announcement, ""Surrender"", the first single from Young Heart was released. Her second single, ""Loneliness"" was released on 12 February.","Studio albums

Zoe Birkett,N/A,"Birkett began attending stage school when she was just three years old. She had had hopes of being a performer and had previously auditioned unsuccessfully to be in S Club 7, finishing in the final 12. She trained at the Amanda McGlynn Academy in Middlesbrough and the Lorraine Murray Dance School.

In 2002, Birkett finished fourth on the first series of Pop Idol, behind Will Young, Gareth Gates and Darius Danesh, and being the highest placed female on the show. During the programme, she performed such songs as Whitney Houston's ""One Moment in Time"", ""I Will Always Love You"" and ""I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)""; Aretha Franklin's ""I Say a Little Prayer""; ABBA's ""Thank You For the Music"" and Judy Garland's ""Get Happy"". After the show, Birkett was the warm-up act on Pop Idol winners Will Young's and Gareth Gates' tour where she performed in front of 18,000 people. She performed three songs for Pop Idol: The Big Band Album.In 2003, Birkett signed a recording contract with 19 Recordings and released one single, ""Treat Me Like a Lady"", on 13 January 2003. The track was co-written by fellow Pop Idol contestant Sarah Whatmore, but only reached number 12 in the UK Singles Chart on 25 January. This quickly drifted down the chart and faded. Soon after, Birkett was dropped by the record label.

Birkett appeared in Robert C.

Anita Blay,"Blay was born in Clapton, east London to Ghanaian parents and raised in the city's Hackney area. Her mother left the family when she was 12 years old. She cultivated an interest in music as a teenager, songwriting with rapper Plan B at a youth placement scheme when she was 16. She completed A-levels in English, sociology and theology. Blay took a series of day jobs in her late teens, including one at Southwark Council, but found full-time employment incompatible with her lifestyle and decided to pursue music professionally.","Blay adopted the stage name thecocknbullkid, explaining, ""Initially I just liked the way it sounded—it gave me aural satisfaction. Then I liked the idea of calling myself a bulls**tter [sic], it's all a bit tongue-in-cheek."" She began uploading material to her MySpace profile and networked with music producers, live promoters and managers.

Blay released her debut single, ""On My Own"", in April 2008, followed by performances at the Glastonbury Festival and on the TV programme Later... with Jools Holland later in the year. She toured Germany with Vice magazine's Vice Live tour in late 2008. Her second single, ""I'm Not Sorry"" was released in March 2009, and by May 2009, she had signed to Moshi Moshi through Island Records. Following Blay's appearance at the American music festival SXSW, her debut EP, Querelle, was released in the US via Iamsound Records in August 2009 to positive reviews from Prefix and Spin magazines. To mark the EP's release, Blay issued a free mixtape featuring her own tracks alongside songs by artists including Late of the Pier and Diana Ross. Also in 2009, Blay appeared alongside Alessi's Ark, Micachu, Roisin Murphy, and Sinead O'Connor on a cover of Chaka Khan's ""I'm Every Woman"", a charity single released to support ActionAid.

Blay was expected to release a full-length album in 2009, with production from Blue May, Dave McCracken, Joseph Mount (of Metronomy), and Mark-Anthony Tieku. By 2010, Blay said she had scrapped the album's original sound; in 2011, a 12-track album from the initial recording sessions titled Adolescence leaked onto the Internet, and Blay actively encouraged her fans to download it.Blay announced the change of her stage name to CocknBullKid in June 2010 and released the song ""CocknBullKid"" as a free download. Her first single with Moshi Moshi/Island, ""One Eye Closed"", was released in November 2010, and she opened for Marina and the Diamonds and Kele on their respective tours in October and November. The follow-up single, ""Hold on to Your Misery"", was released in January 2011, and third single ""Asthma Attack"" followed in April 2011. These releases preceded her debut album, Adulthood, which was recorded in London, Paris and Stockholm with production from Liam Howe, and includes contributions from Gonzales, Peter Morén (of Peter Bjorn and John), and Joseph Mount. It was released in April 2011, and a fourth and final single, ""Yellow"", was issued in August 2011. Spin magazine and The Guardians Michael Cragg named Adulthood one of the best albums of the year.

Blay promoted Adulthood with support slots on UK tours by Janelle Monáe (from February 2011), Duran Duran (May 2011), and Patrick Wolf (October and November 2011). She collaborated with several other artists during 2011; featuring on the track ""In Doubt"" by Black Devil Disco Club, and on The Shoes' song ""Cliché"" (from their album Crack My Bones) and their remix of Wolf Gang's ""Dancing with the Devil"" (alongside Mz. Bratt). Blay co-wrote material for Nicola Roberts' solo album Cinderella's Eyes (2011), but her tracks did not make the final cut of the album.Blay recorded ""Doing It Wrong"", the theme tune for the BBC Three television series Some Girls, which premiered in 2012. The same year she featured on Niyi's ""Ur No Good"" and the single ""Never Let Go"" by Rowdy Superstar, with whom she formed a side project called X&Y.

Blay has also been working on a second solo album, according to her publisher Downtown Music Publishing. In 2015, Blay (credited as CocknBullKid) was featured on the Boxed In track ""Lo Life"".

In April 2016, Blay's songwriting collaboration with Little Mix on their song ""Hair"", released from their 2015 album Get Weird, was released as an official single, featuring vocals from Sean Paul, and is classed as the biggest and most successful songwriting collaboration that Blay has took part in so far in her music career.

May 2018 saw Blay co-write a OneRepublic track titled ""Start Again"". It was featured on the second season of the hit Netflix show 13 Reasons Why.

In September 2020, Blay collaborated with Kae Tempest and High Contrast on a standalone single ""Time Is Hardcore"". The track was premiered on August 12 on BBC Radio 1 by Clara Amfo, and was subsequently selected as Adele Roberts' ""Tune of the Week"".

In January 2021, Blay updated her social media profiles from CocknBullKid to Anita Blay, whilst posting a simple message ""BRB"". This has prompted speculation amongst fans (most notably Perez Hilton) that she may be releasing music under her own artist name some time in 2021.Full article & discography at Antony & Cleopatra.

In 2014, Blay and Alexander Burnett (of Australian band Sparkadia) formed a deep house duo called Antony & Cleopatra, who featured on three singles in 2014: Lancelot's ""Givin' It Up"", Beni's ""Protect"", and Sammy Bananas' ""Money Time"".

Sarah Brightman,"At age 18, in 1979, Brightman married Andrew Graham-Stewart, who at that time managed the German band Tangerine Dream. She later met Andrew Lloyd Webber when she performed in Cats. In 1983, Brightman divorced Graham-Stewart and later that same year, Lloyd Webber divorced his first wife, Sarah Hugill, with whom he had two children. Lloyd Webber and Brightman married on 22 March 1984 and their relationship quickly became the subject of intense media and tabloid scrutiny until their divorce in 1990. They are on friendly terms; in 2006, at the 20th London anniversary of The Phantom of the Opera, Lloyd Webber called Brightman a ""wonderful woman"" and ""absolutely beloved mentor"", and she performed at the 25th anniversary of the musical in 2011. He appeared as a special guest in her 1997 concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London.

Brightman had a 10-year relationship with Frank Peterson, during which they tried and were unsuccessful in having children. In an interview with British magazine Hello!, she said motherhood would have been ""lovely"" but accepted that she would never have a child.","In 1981, Brightman auditioned for the new musical Cats, by composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, and was cast as Jemima. After a year in Cats, Brightman took over from Bonnie Langford as Kate in The Pirates of Penzance at the Drury Lane Theatre, London, and appeared as Tara Treetops in Masquerade, a musical based on Kit Williams's book of the same title. In that year she left to play the title role in Charles Strouse's children's opera, Nightingale.

Enticed by a rave review, Webber went to watch her in the show one evening and was greatly impressed by her performance. Though she had appeared in his musical Cats, Webber had not previously singled Brightman out as a great talent. The two married in 1984, and Brightman appeared in Lloyd Webber's subsequent musicals including The Phantom of the Opera and Song and Dance, as well as the mass Requiem, which was written and composed for Lloyd Webber's father.

In 1985, Brightman's recording of ""Pie Jesu"" was a strong commercial success, selling 25,000 copies on the first day of release and peaking at number 3, despite the lyrics being in Latin. With classical music permeating the Lloyd Webber household (Brightman was in heavy operatic training at the time), Lloyd Webber was moved to write the Requiem Mass as a tribute to his father. Its Manhattan premiere, starring Plácido Domingo and Brightman, was filmed by the BBC and PBS for later broadcast. The LP eventually became UK's top selling classical album of the year and earned Brightman a Grammy nomination as Best New Classical Artist.

Brightman starred as Christine Daaé in Lloyd Webber's adaptation of The Phantom of the Opera. The role of Christine was written specifically for her. Lloyd Webber refused to open The Phantom of the Opera on Broadway unless Brightman played Christine. Initially, the American Actors' Equity Association balked, because of their policy that any non-American performer must be an international star. Lloyd Webber had to cast an American in a leading role in his next West End musical before Equity would allow Brightman to appear (a promise he kept in casting Aspects of Love). In the end, it was a compromise that was successful. Phantom received $17 million in advance sales prior to opening night on 26 January 1988. The original cast album was the first in British musical history to enter the music charts at number one. Album sales now exceed forty million worldwide—the biggest selling cast album of all time—and has gone six times platinum in the United States, twice platinum in the UK, nine times platinum in Germany, four times platinum in the Netherlands, 11 times platinum in Korea and 31 times platinum in Taiwan. Despite the success both in London and on Broadway, Brightman received mostly negative reception from critics for her performance and was not nominated for Best Lead Actress in a Musical at the Tony Awards. While some reviewers praised Brightman for her singing, her acting was widely criticized.

After leaving Phantom, she performed in a tour of Lloyd Webber's music throughout England, Canada and the United States, and performed Requiem in the Soviet Union. Studio recordings from this time include the single ""Anything But Lonely"" from Aspects of Love and two solo albums: the 1988 album The Trees They Grow So High, a collection of folk songs accompanied by piano, and the 1989 album The Songs That Got Away, a compilation of obscure musical theatre songs from shows by such composers as Irving Berlin and Stephen Sondheim. Brightman also sang the song ""Make Believe"" during the credits of the children's film Grandpa; Howard Blake composed the music and wrote the lyrics.

She was a subject of the television programme This Is Your Life in 1989 when she was surprised by Michael Aspel at RAF Wittering in Lincolnshire.

By 1990, Brightman and Lloyd Webber had separated. After their highly publicized divorce, Brightman played the lead in Lloyd Webber's Aspects in London opposite Michael Praed, before transferring to Broadway. Her subsequent solo album, As I Came of Age, was an eclectic collection of folk-rock and musical theatre songs that Brightman herself chose.In 1992, Brightman performed with José Carreras at the Barcelona Olympic Games singing the theme song ""Amigos Para Siempre"" (""Friends Forever"") to a worldwide audience of 3 billion people. Following the appearance, Brightman pursued solo recording, and inspired by the German band Enigma, she requested to work with one of its members, Frank Peterson. Their first release together was Dive (1993), a water-themed pop album that featured ""Captain Nemo"", a cover of a song by the Swedish electronica band Dive. The album received her first Gold award in Canada.

Brightman and Peterson's second collaboration yielded the pop rock album, Fly (1995) with the single ""A Question of Honor""—a mélange of electronic, rock, classical strings and excerpts from the Alfredo Catalani opera La Wally. The song and the video were introduced at the World Boxing Championship match between Germany's Henry Maske and Graciano Rocchigiani.

In 1997, Brightman released the album Timeless/Time to Say Goodbye. It remains as Brightman's biggest-selling album. It went gold, platinum and/or multi-platinum in 21 countries, selling over 1.4 million copies in the US, and topped the Billboard Top Classical Crossover Albums chart in the US for 35 weeks. The lead single from the album, ""Time to Say Goodbye"", was the second song that Brightman debuted at the World Boxing Championship in Germany. This duet with tenor Andrea Bocelli became an international hit and sold more than 3 million copies in Germany. The album eventually sold over 12 million copies worldwide.

In March 1998, Brightman produced her first own PBS special, Sarah Brightman: In Concert at the Royal Albert Hall. The same year, Brightman starred in A Gala Christmas in Vienna alongside Plácido Domingo, Helmut Lotti and Riccardo Cocciante singing traditional Christmas carols. On 7 April 1998 she was one of the guest stars in Andrew Lloyd Webber's 50th birthday celebration singing Hosanna with Dennis O'Neill, The Phantom of the Opera's title song with Antonio Banderas, ""All I Ask of You"" with Michael Ball and ""Music of the Night"", both also from Phantom of the Opera.

With the success of Timeless, Brightman released her next album, Eden in 1998. She personally selected each song and convinced the Italian composer Ennio Morricone to let her set lyrics to one of his film compositions, ""Gabriel's Oboe"" from the film The Mission resulting in ""Nella Fantasia"". The album, unlike Time to Say Goodbye, incorporated more pop music elements. Reviews were mixed – LAUNCHcast deemed Eden ""deliriously sappy"", while Allmusic called Eden ""a winning combination"". Eden reached No. 1 on the US Billboard Top Classical Crossover Albums chart and No. 65 on the Billboard 200 chart and was certified Gold in the United States.In 2000, La Luna was released. For this album, Brightman chose songs drawing on pop, vintage jazz, and high opera, in homages to Dvořák, Beethoven and Billie Holiday. La Luna reached No. 1 on the US Billboard Top Internet Albums and peaked at No. 17 on the Billboard 200 chart, becoming Brightman's second highest-selling album in the United States with sales of 900,000 and reaching Gold certification. It became her biggest-selling album in Asia, with a quintuple platinum certification in Taiwan.

At her 2000 PBS La Luna concert, Brightman sang ""There for Me"" in a duet with an up-and-coming star, Josh Groban. At the end of 2001, Billboard magazine noted Brightman as the most important classical crossover artist from the United Kingdom.

In 2001, Brightman released Classics, an anthology including highlights from three of Brightman's chart-topping releases along with seven new tracks; this was released worldwide except Europe. In the US the album peaked at No. 66 on the Billboard 200 chart and went Gold. In Canada it peaked at No. 9 and was certified Platinum; and in Japan, Classics became Brightman's most successful release at the time with 300,000 units sold and reaching Platinum status.

Her 2003 album Harem represented another departure: a Middle Eastern-themed album influenced by dance music. On Harem, Brightman collaborated with artists such as Ofra Haza and Iraqi singer Kazem al-Saher. Nigel Kennedy contributed violin tracks to the songs ""Free"" and ""The War is Over"" and Jaz Coleman contributed arrangements.

The album peaked at No. 29 on the Billboard 200 chart, No. 1 on the Billboard Top Classical Crossover Albums chart, No. 1 on the Swedish Album Chart, and yielded a No. 1 dance/club single with the remix of the title track. Some time later, another single from the album (the ballad ""Free"", cowritten with Sophie B. Hawkins) became a second Top-10 hit on this chart.

The albums Eden, La Luna and Harem were accompanied by live world tours which incorporated the theatricality of her stage origins. Brightman acknowledged this in an interview, saying, ""They're incredibly complicated...[but also] natural. I know what works, what doesn't work, all the old tricks"". In both 2000 and 2001, Brightman was among the top 10 most popular British performers in the US, with concert sales grossing $7.2 million from 34 shows in 2000 and over $5 million from 21 shows in 2001.

In 2004, the Harem World Tour grossed $60 million and sold 700,000 tickets, $15 million and 225,000 sales of which came from the North American leg, although with ticket prices raised 30% from previous tours, average sales per venue were up 65%. In North America, Harem tour promoters Clear Channel Entertainment (now Live Nation) took the unusual step of advertising to theatre subscribers, in an effort to reach fans of Brightman's Broadway performances, and also sold VIP tickets, at $750 each, which included on-stage seating during the concert and a backstage pass. Tour reviews were mixed: one critic from the New York Times called the La Luna tour ""not so much divine but post-human"" and ""unintentionally disturbing: a beautiful argument of emptiness.""

Television specials on PBS were produced for nearly every Brightman album in the US; a director of marketing has credited these as her number-one source of exposure in the country. Her concert for Eden was among PBS's highest-grossing pledge events.Brightman released a DVD collection of her music videos on 3 October 2006 under the title of Diva: The Video Collection. The Singles Collection is the accompanying CD, released on the same date. The album marked the first time Brightman released a greatest hits album in the United States; it reached No. 1 on the Billboard Top Classical Crossover Albums chart. In Japan, the album debuted and peaked at No. 2 with 77,000 copies sold on its first week of release, and became Japan's biggest-selling classical album of 2007. Subsequently, it was Japan's fifteenth best-selling international album of the 2000s decade. By 2008, the album achieved a Double-Platinum certification. With Diva, Brightman was also South Korea's best-selling international artist of 2010 as the album topped the international charts all throughout the year. Diva was certified Quintuple Platinum and its digital single, ""Nella Fantasia"" sold over 2 million units. Other releases in Europe were The Very Best of 1990–2000 and Classics: The Best of Sarah Brightman.

On 1 July 2007, Brightman appeared at the Concert for Diana held at Wembley Stadium, London, an event organised to celebrate the life of Princess Diana of Wales, where she sang ""All I Ask of You"" from The Phantom of the Opera with Josh Groban. Around 15 million people across the UK watched Concert for Diana at home, and it was broadcast to over 500 million homes in 140 countries. On 7 July 2007 Brightman performed four songs (""Nessun Dorma"", ""La Luna"", ""Nella Fantasia"" and ""Time to Say Goodbye"") at the Live Earth Concert Series, and debuted her single ""Running"" at the 2007 IAAF Championships in Osaka, Japan. In this period Brightman also recorded a duet with Anne Murray singing ""Snowbird"", which was included on Murray's 2007 album Anne Murray Duets: Friends and Legends.

On 29 January 2008, Brightman released her first album in five years: Symphony, influenced by gothic music. In the United States, it became Brightman's most successful chart entry and also her highest ranked album on Billboard's ""Top 200 Albums"". It was also a No. 1 album on two other Billboard charts: ""Top Internet Albums"" and ""Top Classical Crossover Albums"". The album moved there 32,033 copies in first week, according to Nielsen Soundscan. The album was a top 5 release in China, Taiwan, Canada, Mexico and Japan and a top 20 across Europe.

Featured on the album were artists Andrea Bocelli, Fernando Lima, and KISS vocalist Paul Stanley, who duets with Brightman on ""I Will Be with You"", the album version of the theme song to the 10th Pokémon motion picture, Dialga VS Palkia VS Darkrai (Pokémon: The Rise of Darkrai).

Special guests who sang duets with Brightman include Italian tenor Alessandro Safina, Argentinean countertenor Fernando Lima, and British singer Chris Thompson.

Brightman performed ""Pie Jesu"" and ""There You'll Be"" at the United States Memorial Day concert on 25 May 2008 held on the west lawn of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. The show was broadcast live on PBS before a concert audience of 300,000, as well as to American troops serving around the world on the American Forces Radio and Television Network. Brightman made her feature film debut as Blind Mag in the rock musical film Repo! The Genetic Opera which was released on 7 November 2008. Brightman was cast in the film at the last minute after the original actress who was cast for the role was dropped.

On 8 August 2008, Brightman sang the Olympic theme song, ""You and Me"", with Chinese star Liu Huan in both Mandarin and English at the Beijing Olympics opening ceremony. The performance was broadcast to over five billion viewers. In the 26 hours after the performance, ""You and Me"" was downloaded 5.7 million times.

Brightman released her first holiday album, entitled A Winter Symphony on 4 November 2008. The album debuted at number No. 38 on the Billboard 200 and scored a number six in the Top Holiday Albums. The album was composed of an array of Christmas favourites including ""Silent Night"" and ""In the Bleak Midwinter"". Also featured are a duet in ""Ave Maria"" with Mexican Tenor Fernando Lima, covers of pop tracks including ABBA's instrumental song ""Arrival"" plus a rendition of Neil Diamond's, ""I've Been this Way Before"".

To accompany Symphony and A Winter Symphony, Brightman embarked on a tour in Autumn 2008; ""The Symphony World Tour"", that included virtual and holographic stage sets.In response to persistent calls for a global release of the Symphony: Live in Vienna concert, EMI Music launched worldwide the PBS special which featured Brightman's performance at Vienna's St. Stephen's Cathedral on 16 January 2008, in both audio and visual formats. The Symphony—Live in Vienna television special debuted on PBS in March 2008 during the network's spring pledge drive and aired throughout the month. Symphony: Live in Vienna was listed as the thirteenth best-selling album of the year in Mexico.

The music of Brightman was featured in the film Amarufi: Megami no hôshû (international title: Amalfi: Rewards of the Goddess), which was a special production to mark Fuji Television's 50th anniversary, the first Japanese film to be shot entirely on location in Italy.

Penny Broadhurst,N/A,"Penny Broadhurst first started performing her own material as a spoken word performer when she was a student in Norwich in 1998. Her performances were delivered in a broad Yorkshire accent and often accompanied by pop and rock music. Her first album of spoken word with music, Blue Bank got radio play on BBC 6 Music, and the NME declared ""...You can't mosh to poetry, but if you could, then you'd mosh to this."" A BBC Tees review described one of her performances as ""leaving a tough act to follow.""

She gradually moved away from using just the spoken word, and began to write and sing her own pop songs and dance routines, working with producers Ed Heaton, and Si McGrath of Hightone Productions. Clint Boon of Radio Xfm Manchester said of her songs : ""She's unsigned, but she sounds like an established act to me. I can see why she calls herself the Queen of Pop.""

She has appeared at Ladyfest around the UK and literary festivals including Off The Shelf and Ilkley Literature Festival. She was a member of the Yorkshire young writers' initiative The Writing Squad, funded by the Arts Council. In Summer 2005 she played at Glastonbury and in 2005 and 2006 at the Truck festival. She has also recently appeared at other festivals including Latitude Festival (2006 and 2007), Wireless Festival (2007), Solfest (2007) and Indietracks (2008) and made a television appearance on BBC Look North.

As well as having radio play on BBC Radio 1, BBC 6 Music, and Radio Magnetic in the UK (on their playlist), Penny Broadhurst's work has been broadcast on FM4 in Austria, Slovakia and other local and international stations. Her songs have also been featured on Xfm and Dandelion Radio.

Sam Brown (singer),"Brown has two children, born 1993 and 1995, with her ex-husband, producer and musician Robin Evans.

On 16 June 1991, Brown's mother Vicki Brown died aged 50 from breast cancer.","Brown signed a recording contract with A&M in 1986. Her most successful song with A&M was ""Stop!"", released as a single in 1988. She issued an album of the same name that same year. Other singles taken from the album included ""Walking Back to Me"", ""This Feeling"" and her cover version of ""Can I Get a Witness"". The album Stop! has sold over two-and-a-half million copies worldwide, doing particularly well in the UK and Australia. Brown's second studio album, April Moon (1990), included two hit singles, ""Kissing Gate"" and ""With a Little Love"". Three further singles were released from the album: ""Mindworks"", ""Once in Your Life"" and ""As One"". She also played the ukulele.

Brown's third studio album, 43 Minutes..., was made around the same time that her mother was dying from breast cancer. A&M, Brown's record label at the time, were not satisfied with the album and wanted some potential hit singles recorded and added to the track listing. Brown, unwilling to compromise and after a protracted legal battle, bought back the master recordings of the album and released them in 1992 on her own label Pod Music, a year after the death of her mother. Few copies were initially released, but it was reissued in 2004.

Brown provided backing vocals for Pink Floyd on their 14th studio album, The Division Bell, released in 1994, and accompanied them on their tour to promote the release. Her involvement was documented on the following year's Pink Floyd release, Pulse, in which she sang backing vocals and was the first lead vocalist on the song ""The Great Gig in the Sky"". In 1995, she had a minor chart hit with a duet with fellow singer-songwriter Fish, entitled ""Just Good Friends"". In 1997, Brown returned with her fourth studio album Box, released via the independent record label Demon Music Group. Tracks on this album included ""Embrace the Darkness"", ""Whisper"" and ""I Forgive You"" which was co-written with Maria McKee. McKee's version of the song originally appeared on her second album, You Gotta Sin to Get Saved.

In 2000, her fifth studio album, ReBoot, was released via another independent label, Mud Hut, as was the single ""In Light of All That's Gone Before."" In 2003, Brown formed the band Homespun with Dave Rotheray,. The group has released three albums. Brown also released several solo recordings in this period, including an EP, Ukulele and Voice. In 2004, Jon Lord released Beyond the Notes, for which she wrote almost all the lyrics. In late 2006, she undertook an extensive UK tour as special guest of her father, Joe Brown. The shows also included appearances by her brother, Pete Brown.

In 2007, seven years after her last album, Brown released Of the Moment. She also returned to the Top 10 of the UK Albums Chart in October 2007, when ""Valentine Moon"" was included on Jools Holland's hit album Best of Friends.

That same year she lost her singing voice, and for as yet unknown reasons has not been able to sing since. In an interview in 2013 she explained that ""I can't get vocal cord closure and achieve the proper pitch simultaneously. It feels like there are some muscles that aren't working."" After a cyst was found on her vocal cords, she had the cyst successfully removed, but problems with her voice persisted, leaving her unable to hold a note.

Brown currently runs the International Ukulele Club of Sonning Common, the North London Ukulele Collective and the People's Ukulele Brigade (PUB). Brown is also a patron of Tech Music Schools in London, made up of Vocaltech, Guitar-X, Keyboardtech and Drumtech.","Studio albums

Tara Brown (singer),"Tara Brown was born in Tooting, South London. The 6th of 7 children born to Jamaican parents, Brown was raised in a very musical family with Grandparents, Uncles and Aunts many of whom were musical instrumentalists. Brown recalls becoming truly engaged with music at age 7, began composing age 10 and co-wrote her first song at age 11. From that age Brown's keen interest in singing and performing took flight and led to her joining the church choir.

Brown graduated Royal Holloway, University of London with a 2:1 BA Honours degree in English and Drama. She went on to attend the London College of Contemporary Music where she completed a course in vocal training.

She worked at The Petchey Academy Secondary School in Hackney as a drama teacher.","During the university years, alongside her involvement with the choir, Brown joined a band called Nexus Groove Unit. This covers/funk based unit saw her gigging in a lot of bars and music venues across London for a few years.

Brown's 2008 experience in the Christian-based musical training programme ""Immerse"" marked a catalytic point in her musical journey. She began to share the stage with artists such as Nicole C. Mullen. Whilst on tour as an actress in 2011 she was overheard singing and playing her guitar during some down time between rehearsals for a play in Edinburgh. On her return to London, Brown found that ""news"" of her singing abilities had created a buzz and attracted some media attention, with Premier Christian Radio Colourful Radio and UGN JAMZ 24/7 being particularly supportive. Around this time Brown independently released two vocal tracks – ""You Said"" and ""21"" – on iTunes which attracted good rotation across those radio stations and the urban gospel network in the UK as a whole.

The impact of Brown's appearance in the 2012 series of Time2Shine led directly to the recording of her debut album, Disappear Imperfect. The album will be released early September 2013, with a live performance launch at The Jazz Café, London.Brown is trained in tap dance, musical theatre and acting. She began acting with the Young Vic youth theatre and went on to perform in the Talawa Theatre Company young people's theatre.

She revealed in an interview that the reason why she is not attempting to represent the UK is because the BBC felt it was a conflict of interest for a former X Factor contestant to be promoted by them given their involvement with the Eurovision and the fact that they already have their own singing contest, The Voice UK, although former X Factor contestant Andy Abraham represented the UK in 2008. In March 2015, Brucknell announced that she would release a Broadway album later in the year which would be recorded at Abbey Road Studios.

Clemency Burton-Hill,"Burton-Hill married James Roscoe, a British diplomat, in 2008. The couple moved to New York in 2009 where Roscoe was posted to the UK Mission to the United Nations in New York and returned to London in 2013. The couple have two sons.

Burton-Hill is a trustee of the children's education charity Dramatic Need.

In 20 January 2020, she collapsed in New York City after suffering a brain haemorrhage and underwent emergency surgery. Doctors removed half of her skull at Mount Sinai West hospital in Manhattan, and she was unconscious for 17 days; it was uncertain how much of her brain would recover. She has recovered with the help of music-based occupational therapy. On 20 January 2021 the first interview with Burton-Hill, who had learned to speak again, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour. She interviewed Elizabeth Day for her Classical Fix podcast in August 2021.",N/A,N/A,N/A,"an English broadcaster, author, novelist, journalist and violinist",1981,N/A,N/A,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clemency_Burton-Hill
Kate Bush,"Some of Bush's songs have contained references to what critics have interpreted as political and social themes, such as ""Breathing"" which addresses the fear of nuclear warfare and ""Army Dreamers"" which examined the grief felt by mothers who lose children serving in the military during war. The tracks ""Wow"" and ""Kashka from Baghdad"" contain references to gay and LGBT themes. In a 1985 interview with The NewMusic, Bush stated ""I've never felt I've written from a political point of view, it's always been an emotional point of view that just happens to perhaps be a political situation.""

During the 1979 United Kingdom general election campaign, Bush, who at the time was on a live concert tour of the UK, posed for a photograph alongside the Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan. When asked about her political beliefs in a 1985 interview with Hot Press, Bush replied that she preferred not to discuss how she voted and added ""I don't feel I am a political thinker at all. I don't really understand politics.""

In the Comic Strip Presents episode GLC: The Carnage Continues..., she produced and sang on the theme song Ken. The song was a satirical take on how Hollywood glamourises and fictionalises political figures, in this particular case Ken Livingstone, the former leader of the Greater London Council, and the lyrics parodied the theme from Shaft.

In 2016, Canadian news magazine Maclean's published an interview in which Bush was asked about the role of misogyny in the defeat of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 United States presidential election. Bush pointed out that the UK, unlike the US, did have a female premier, Theresa May, who a few months earlier had become the Conservative Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. It quoted Bush as saying: ""I actually really like her and think she's wonderful. I think it's the best thing that's happened to us in a long time ... It is great to have a woman in charge of the country. She's very sensible and I think that's a good thing at this point in time."" In 2019, Bush published a clarifying statement on her website saying that she was not a tribal Tory supporter and did not endorse any political parties. She wrote: ""Over the years, I have avoided making political comments in interviews. My response to the interviewer was not meant to be political but rather was in the defence of women in power.""",N/A,"

Bilinda Butcher,"Butcher was born and raised in London and later relocated with her parents and older sister Jo-Anne. Butcher and her family moved to Golden Valley, Derbyshire a small hamlet in the countryside. Her forename is an alternate spelling of Belinda and was chosen by her mother. Butcher has been quoted as saying, ""if I'd been a guy I would have been named Bill, but since I was a girl it became Bilinda"". During one of his radio shows, BBC Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel once said Butcher was ""being pretentious and tried to be special by spelling [her] name differently"".

Butcher has said that growing up in Golden Valley she was considered ""a weirdo"" as she wore clothes based on 1920s fashion and listened to records on a portable gramophone. Butcher stated: ""My mother thought I was up in the clouds. I never watched the news or read the papers; it was like I lived in another era. Everybody was into punk and I was living in the '20s and '30s."" At age sixteen, Butcher moved back to London and began studying dance at the Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance, but left after a year.

After leaving Trinity Laban, Butcher worked as a nanny for a French family in London for six months and later moved to Paris for another six months with her partner. The pair moved back to London, squatting in Brixton, and had a child, Toby.","Butcher was recruited as a vocalist for My Bloody Valentine in April 1987. She replaced original vocalist David Conway and shared vocal duties briefly with Joe Byfield. Butcher, whose prior musical experience was playing classical guitar as a child and singing and playing tambourine ""with some girlfriends for fun"", learned that the group needed a backing vocalist from her boyfriend, who had met drummer Colm Ó Cíosóig on a ferry from the Netherlands. At her audition for the band, she sang ""The Bargain Store"", a song from Dolly Parton's 1975 album of the same name. She was chosen as a vocalist ahead of a girl called Julie who was in a relationship with Douglas Hart from The Jesus and Mary Chain.

Butcher was featured as co-vocalist and co-guitarist on My Bloody Valentine's non-album single, ""Strawberry Wine"", and the band's second mini album, Ecstasy, both of which were released in 1987 on Lazy Records. She performed vocals and guitar on all further My Bloody Valentine releases, until the band's second studio album Loveless (1991), on which her guitar duties were performed by co-vocalist and guitarist Kevin Shields. She contributed a third of the lyrics to Isn't Anything (1988) and Loveless, as well as other releases including You Made Me Realise (1988), Glider (1990) and Tremolo (1991).

My Bloody Valentine attempted to record a third studio album after signing with Island Records in October 1992 for a reported £250,000 contract. The band's advance went towards the construction of a home studio in Streatham, South London, which was completed in April 1993. Several technical problems with the studio sent the band into ""semi-meltdown"", according to Shields,. Despite suggestions to the contrary, Butcher never left the band, although she did leave the home studio in Streatham. My Bloody Valentine reunited in 2007, and released their third album, m b v, in 2013.During My Bloody Valentine's hiatus, Butcher collaborated with two major bands. She performed lead vocals on two tracks—""Ballad Night"" and ""Casino Kisschase""—on the hip hop band Collapsed Lung's album Cooler (1996), and performed backing vocals on the Dinosaur Jr song ""I Don't Think"" from Hand It Over (1997).

Call Me Loop,"Call Me Loop was born as Georgia Buchanan on 23 December 1990. She began writing songs and performing at the age of five, and participated in talent shows at school and summer camp. For her fourteenth birthday, her parents paid for the opportunity to record her first song in a professional recording studio. After attending Guildford High School, from which she graduated from in 2009. she studied drama at the University of Exeter. After her graduation, she relocated from Surrey to South London in order to pursue a career in music.","Originally known by the name Loop (which is also the name of a 1980s indie band who got back together in the 2010s), Buchanan rebranded herself as Call Me Loop. In April 2016, Call Me Loop independently released her debut single, ""Thinking of You"". This was followed by various single releases including ""Losing My Mind"", ""As If"" and ""Know Me Better"". ""As If"" received attention from the public when Elton John selected the song to play on his Beats 1 radio show. In May 2017, she supported English DJ Jonas Blue on his European tour. Later that month, she released a self-titled extended play, which was acclaimed by critics. Later that year, she released ""Maybe I'm a Liar"", which Popjustice described as a ""sprightly, R&B‑infused tropical slinker"".

Following the release of more singles including ""Give 'n' Take"", ""Love the Lie"", ""Business"" and ""Silly Boy"", Call Me Loop released her second extended play, Drama. Georgia Maher of The Line of Best Fit described Drama as a ""solid collection of vibrant, infectious pop wonders"", and titled her a ""rising pop maverick"", complimenting her songwriting ability. In 2020, ""React"", a song she co-wrote, was released by The Pussycat Dolls. She expressed her excitement at writing for them, commenting: ""To have written it for an iconic girl band that I grew up listening to is just mind-blowing."" This was followed by the release of her next singles, ""Downhill From Here"" and ""Strike"".","Call Me Loop—* Released: 12 May 2017 * Label: Independent * Format: Digital download,Drama—* Released: 8 March 2019 * Label: Independent * Format: Digital download,""Looking at You""—2016—Non-album single,""Losing My Mind""—2016—Call Me Loop,""As If""—2017—Call Me Loop,""Maybe I'm a Liar""—2017—Non-album singles—Call Me Loop,""Give 'n' Take""—2017—Non-album singles—2018,""Business""—Drama—Non-album singles—2018,""Cry Like Kim K"" (with Lisa Ajax)—Non-album single—Non-album singles—2018,""Silly Boy""—2019—Drama—2018,""Self Love""—2019—TBA—2018,""Downhill From Here""—2020—TBA,2020—""React""—The Pussycat Dolls—Non-album single—Co-writer,",N/A,English singer and songwriter,23/11/1990,2016–present,N/A,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_Me_Loop

Mara Carlyle,N/A,"Carlyle's first recorded appearance was on the Plaid album Not For Threes (Warp Records, 1997). She subsequently sang on Plaid's next two albums, Rest Proof Clockwork (1999) and Double Figure (2001). Having sung on Matthew Herbert's big band album Goodbye Swingtime (2003), Carlyle signed to Herbert's label, Accidental Records. Her debut album The Lovely was released in July 2004. It consisted mostly of original compositions, as well as a few reworkings of pieces of classical music, recorded at Carlyle's home. ""I Blame You Not"" is an English-language version of Schumann's ""'Ich grolle nicht"". Another track, ""Pianni"", was featured in the IKEA ""Happy Inside"" television commercial in which 100 cats are let loose in the retailer's Wembley store.

In May 2005 Carlyle released an EP, I Blame Dido, containing ""I Blame You Not"" and a version of Henry Purcell's ""Dido's Lament"".

After receiving critical acclaim for The Lovely, Carlyle signed to EMI in 2007. She recorded her second album in London with producer Dan Carey (who has worked with The Kills and with Kylie Minogue). The album was scheduled for release in June 2008, but was shelved during the restructuring that affected EMI after the label was bought by private equity firm, Terra Firma. Carlyle described this as a period of limbo, in which the album ""continues to languish pointlessly, like a pirated ship off the coast of Somalia"".

December 2008 saw the release of Classist, a collaboration with composer Max de Wardener under the name ""Max de Mara"". Carlyle contributed four tracks adapted from Handel, Purcell, Walford Davies and Jacques Offenbach. The album was a limited edition of 333 copies available through Stanley Donwood's Six Inch Records.

After protracted legal negotiations with EMI, Carlyle regained the rights to the album, originally called Nuzzle, and changed the title to Floreat, meaning ""Let it flourish"". Floreat was released in August 2011 to critical acclaim. The Independent on Sunday declared it ""a classic"". The album is an eclectic collection across 10 tracks, ranging from the delicate orchestration of ""Bowlface en Provence"", through the near hip-hop style of ""Away with those self loving lads"" culminating in the piano led jazz ballard ""The Devil and me"". The album was written and arranged by Carlyle, with lyrics that, at times, deliberately sit at odds to their polite framing, such as on ""Pearl"". Hot Chip producer Dan Carey provided an overall pop flourish.

In 2013 she provided vocals, and appeared in the video for the song ""She Burns"" by the co-founder of Hot Chip, Joe Goddard.

In 2014 she joined the presenting team of the BBC Radio 3 programme Late Junction. Also in late 2014, Carlyle supported Goldfrapp at their concert of 18 November at the Royal Albert Hall, London, England.

In May 2015, Carlyle played her first headline concert for over two years at Rich Mix, Shoreditch, London, and delivered a two-hour setlist of 17 songs, including numbers from ""The Lovely"" and ""Floreat"", and covers of ""He Makes My Day"", originally by Robert Palmer, ""It Don't Bother Me"" by Bert Jansch and ""Ex Factor"", originally by Lauryn Hill. She also showcased a new song, tentatively titled 'Murderous Me' from her upcoming, as yet untitled, 3rd album. The band consisted of Mara Carlyle on vocals, ukulele and musical saw, Tom Herbert on double bass, Dan Teper on accordion, Liam Byrne on viola da gamba and James McVinnie on piano. Support artist was cellist Laura Moody.

In December 2015, Carlyle teamed up with KT Tunstall and Max de Wardener, to provide a live soundtrack to Frank Borzage's 1927 romantic silent classic 7th Heaven at the BFI London Southbank.

In 2016, Carlyle collaborated with Gaspard Augé and Xavier de Rosnay, from French Electro House outfit Justice, on their 3rd Album ""Woman"". Seen as a tribute to femininity, the 10 track album is a romantic, amatory, disco opus on which Carlyle assumed the role of 'Vibe Editor' and produced the choral and orchestral sessions with the London Contemporary Orchestra. She contributed vocals on several tracks, along with musical saw on the album standout track ""Chorus"", described as a Morricone/Queen mash-up. In 2018, during the Woman Worldwide tour, the duo released a remix version of the album, recording the tracks in a similar way that they are performed during their live stage show. Entitled 'Woman Worldwide' the album went on to win the Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic album in 2019

In April 2017 she made a documentary programme to examine the life and vocal magnificence of her beloved Ella Fitzgerald for BBC Radio 4 to mark the centenary of her birth, entitled ""Ella Fitzgerald: A Glorious Noise"".

As well as singing, and playing the ukulele, Carlyle is an exponent of the musical saw which is a common instrument in Russian folk music and American vaudeville. The instrument features on both of her albums to date, most notably in ""Saw Song"" from Floreat.","

Olivia Chaney,"Olivia Chaney was born in Florence, Italy, and grew up in Oxford, England, studying composition, piano and voice. Early influences include her father's record collections and his own renditions of early blues and '60s folk songwriters such as Bob Dylan, Fairport Convention and Bert Jansch.

At 14, Chaney won a joint-first piano and voice scholarship to Chetham's School of Music in Manchester, which was focused on the classical repertoire. She then went on to attend the Royal Academy of Music in London, also on scholarship, where, as an improviser and songwriter, she studied in the jazz course. While at the Academy, Chaney spent much of her time experimenting and collaborating outside the traditional jazz course.","On graduating from the Academy, Chaney taught herself guitar and Indian harmonium, and began performing regularly as a soloist. She has also worked as an actress and singer/multi-instrumentalist at Shakespeare's Globe Theatre in Matthew Dunster's acclaimed production of Troilus and Cressida, and Lucy Bailey and Django Bates' production of Timon of Athens. Chaney has collaborated and shared stages all over the world with artists, composers, producers and bands including Robert Plant, The Decemberists, Kronos Quartet, Zero 7, Alasdair Roberts, Concerto Caledonia and The Labèque Sisters.

In 2010, Chaney recorded a self-released EP. In 2011, she contributed to two compilations for grassroots label Folk Police. She also performed on the live release Revenge of the Folksingers with Scottish artist Alasdair Roberts and period performance group Concerto Caledonia on the Delphian label. Chaney has performed with the Balearic Folk Orchestra, for whom she sang, arranged and played harmonium and piano on the group's Amy Winehouse cover, ""He Can Only Hold Her"", for a Q Magazine tribute. She featured in Alasdair Roberts's 2013 album A Working Wonder Stone.

In November 2013, Olivia Chaney was nominated for two BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards: the Horizon Award and Best Original Song, for ""Swimming in the Longest River"", which is featured on her self-released eponymous EP. At the same time, it was announced that Chaney had signed a record deal with Nonesuch Records.

Chaney's debut album, The Longest River, was released on Nonesuch Records on 28 April 2015. This release, which The Guardian hailed as ""an enchanting and stately creation"", was noted in a number of 'Best of 2015' lists (including Uncut, Mojo and PopMatters). The Independent featured it in their Top 5 Albums of the Year, calling it ""a landmark release"".

In 2017, Chaney was featured singing two songs on Folk Songs, an album with Kronos Quartet, and collaborated with American indie-folk band The Decemberists to release The Queen of Hearts, a joint album of reworked folk tracks under the name Offa Rex. In December 2017, it was announced that their collaborative record had been nominated for a Grammy Award by the Recording Academy for Best Folk Album.

Olivia Chaney released a new solo album, Shelter, on Nonesuch Records on 15 June 2018. The album, which was produced by Thomas Bartlett, includes original songs that Chaney wrote in her family cottage in the hills of the North York Moors, as well as her performance of ""Long Time Gone,"" written by Frank Harford and Tex Ritter and first recorded by The Everly Brothers, and Henry Purcell's ""O Solitude.""

In July 2019, Olivia Chaney was nominated as BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards' Folk Singer of The Year.

On 30 September 2019, Chaney was invited to play at Richard Thompson's 70th Birthday Celebration at the Royal Albert Hall in London. She sang Sandy Denny's song ""Who Knows Where the Time Goes"" and her own ""House on the Hill.""","

Sian Charlesworth,N/A,"In 2007, Charlesworth took part in the auditions with the producers Kim Glover and Samantha Forrest to become a member of a new girl group. Charlesworth was chosen to become a member of the ""City Girls"" (initially called ""Stiletto""). The group was formed by Charlesworth and other three girls: Sheena Rowe, Sophie Leniston and Rebecca Doran. City Girls released their first single ""O.M.G."" in August 2008. The single was written by Darren Monson, Jay Raser and Sheena Rowe, and was produced by Pete Hammond and Jay Raser. The single reached number 3 in the UK Music Week Pop/Club Charts and reached No. 40 in the Bulgarian chart. The group started a promotional tour including a number of performances, appearances on television, radio and newspapers. The song was used as the soundtrack of the video game, Imagine Girl Band. In the beginning of 2009, Charlesworth and Doran left the group and were replaced by Claudia Evans.In 2009, Charlesworth was also a member of a vocal group called ""BVG"". They did a number of gigs but they did not release recording material.In 2010, she became a member of the new British girl group Parade, featuring Jessica Agombar, Emily Biggs, Bianca Claxton and Lauren Deegan. Their debut single ""Louder"" was released on 13 March 2011, which consequently entered in the UK Singles Chart at number 10, and in the Irish Singles Chart at number 41. Parade supported Shakira on the English dates for her 2010 The Sun Comes Out World tour. They also supported Alexandra Burke on her All Night Long 2011 tour, and Shayne Ward on his 2011 Up Close and Personal tour. Their second single ""Perfume"" was released on 19 June 2011 and charted at number 38 in the UK. Their self-titled debut album was released in November 2011 but failed to chart within the top 100, peaking at a low No. 171. Due to the poor sales of the album, Parade were dropped from Asylum Records.

The group spent 2012 working on their second studio album. They collaborated with successful UK producer Tim Powell, who has written and produced for the likes of Girls Aloud and Sugababes, on tracks including ""Light Me Up"". According to Twitter posts, they also worked with Ed Drewett, Fred Ball, MNEK, K-Gee, Jamal Hadaway and Tre Jean-Marie.

On 11 July 2012, through their official blog, they announced ""Light Me Up"" as the first song to be posted online from their new album. It was released as a free download on 1 August 2012.

On 11 February 2013, it was announced through the group's Twitter account that Claxton had decided to leave Parade, and that as a result, the other members had decided not to continue as a group. They also revealed that they were unsigned throughout 2012 to 2013, after being dropped by their record label in 2011. They released an official statement on the subject of their split:

""''Dear Fans, we have some news that we're gutted to announce – sadly Bianca has chosen to leave the band. As you all know, the 5 of us make Parade and without all of us together the band would not be the same! We hope you understand that we've made the difficult decision to not carry on without her, as Parade is about the 5 of us girls. We cannot thank our fans enough for your incredible support as without you lot we wouldn't have achieved the success that we've had. In the last year as an unsigned band, we've written and recorded some wicked tracks and as a thank you we'd like to give something back for your love and patience. Watch our facebook page for more information. Thank you for coming on this rollercoaster of a ride with us and look out for us in the future! Love Parade x''""

Charli XCX,"Charlotte Emma Aitchison was born on 2 August 1992, in Cambridge, England. Her father, Jon Aitchison, is a Scottish entrepreneur and former show-booker, and her mother, Shameera, is a former nurse and flight attendant who was born and raised in Uganda to a Gujarati Indian family. Charli was raised in Start Hill, Essex, and attended Bishop's Stortford College in nearby Bishop's Stortford. While her parents were not very musical, she demonstrated an affinity for music from an early age, being interested in pop acts such as the Spice Girls and Britney Spears. She began writing songs at the age of 14, writing a song called ""Fish and Chips Shop"".

At 14, she convinced her parents to grant her a loan to record her first album, 14, and in early 2008, began posting songs from the album, as well as numerous other demos, on her official Myspace page. This caught the attention of a promoter running numerous illegal warehouse raves and parties in east London, who invited her to perform. She was billed on flyers under the stage name Charli XCX, which was her MSN Messenger display name when she was younger. Despite the illicit nature of the gigs, her parents were supportive of her career and attended several raves with her. In late 2008, while 14 was never commercially released, she released the two singles ""!Franchesckaar!"" and double A-side ""Emelline""/""Art Bitch"", under Orgy Music. She has since frequently expressed her distaste for her music of the time, going as far to call it ""gimmicky dance tracks"" and ""fucking terrible Myspace music"". At the age of 18, Charli moved to London to study for a fine art degree at UCL's Slade School of Fine Art but dropped out in her second year.","In 2010, Charli XCX was signed to Asylum Records. She later described herself as being ""lost"". In an interview with The Guardian, Charli XCX said: ""I was still in school, I'd just come out of this weird rave scene, and I wasn't really sure what to make of that. And when I got signed I hated pop music; I wanted to make bad rap music. I didn't know who I was. I didn't know what I liked. Even though I was signed, I was still figuring it out."" She eventually flew out to Los Angeles to meet producers, and found it ""wasn't working out for me"" until she met with American producer Ariel Rechtshaid. They had a two-hour session and wrote the song ""Stay Away"". She stated that's ""when things started to come together"". Early in 2011, she was featured on the Alex Metric single ""End of the World"". She left during the second year of her degree course at the Slade School of Fine Art to focus on her music career, and in May and November 2011, she released the singles ""Stay Away"" and ""Nuclear Seasons"" respectively, and gained attention from music website Pitchfork, where she earned ""Best New Track"" accolades for both; the former was eventually named to the site's ""Best Tracks of 2011"" list. In addition to Rechtshaid, she began working with Swedish producer Patrik Berger. He sent her two beats, and she quickly wrote songs for each, one of which became ""I Love It"" and the other of which became ""You're the One"". She stated she didn't end up releasing ""I Love It"" herself as she could not reconcile it with her sound, but in 2012, Swedish duo Icona Pop re-recorded the song and released it as a single featuring her vocals. The song became an international hit, hitting number 1 in Charli's home country and climbing to number 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2013. In June, she released ""You're the One"" as a single from her EP of the same name, followed by her debut mixtape Heartbreaks and Earthquakes, a one-track file consisting of eight songs including a cover of the Blood Orange song ""Champagne Coast"" and Odd Future's remix of ""You're the One"". In September, she released a video for ""So Far Away"", and on Halloween, she released a new song called ""Cloud Aura"" featuring Brooke Candy, followed by her second mixtape Super Ultra, released exclusively through her website in November. In early 2013, she released ""You (Ha Ha Ha)"" and announced her debut album, followed by ""What I Like"" in March. True Romance was released in April 2013. It peaked at number 85 on the UK Albums Chart, at number five on the US Billboard Top Heatseekers, and at number 11 on the Australian Hitseekers Albums Chart. The album was received well by music critics, earning a 76/100 on Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"". In May, she released a song with Welsh singer-songwriter Marina and the Diamonds, called ""Just Desserts"", followed by the video for ""Take My Hand"" later that month.Charli XCX began writing her second album in mid-2013, saying she initially wanted to go to India to record, but later decided she wanted to record in France, she said: ""Two months ago, I wanted to go to India and record it, and now I want to record it in France. So I feel like nothing is definite – like, I feel very all-over-the-place at the moment. But at the moment, my heart's set on going to France and recording it, but that was different two months ago, so who knows what's going to happen?"" Frustrated with the music industry, she ended up going to Sweden, isolating herself from her record label, and made a punk-inspired album over a month. Working on the album with Patrik Berger, they made it at a fast pace, saying that it is ""not thought-about, everything really spontaneous [...] We don't think — it's like the first thing that comes out of my mouth is the cut on the record,"" however it was eventually scrapped for a more ""pop""-oriented album. The album included a song called ""Mow That Lawn"", which was debuted live a year later at Ilosaarirock Festival in Finland.

In late 2013, ""SuperLove"" was released as the lead single from the album, and reached number sixty-two on the UK Singles Chart, becoming Charli's first solo entry on the chart. In January 2014, she released a song called ""Allergic to Love"" on her SoundCloud. While writing the album, she did further sessions with Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo, Rostam Batmanglij from Vampire Weekend, production duo Stargate, John Hill, and a session with Dr. Luke which she said ""wasn't for me”. In an interview with DIY magazine, she stated that she wrote the record for girls and wants them to feel ""a sense of empowerment"". Charli explained in her tour diary with Replay Laserblast that the record's genre is still pop, but has a very shouty, girl-power, girl-gang, Bow Wow Wow feel to it at the same time. She also said in an interview with Idolator that the album would be influenced by the Hives, Weezer, the Ramones and 1960s yé-yé music. ""SuperLove"" was eventually scrapped from the album.

In early 2014, she was featured on Australian rapper Iggy Azalea's single ""Fancy""; the track topped the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming both artists' first number-one single on the chart. Charli XCX expanded her portfolio of songwriting for other artists during this period, with credits on Azalea's 2014 single ""Beg for It"", Ryn Weaver's debut single ""OctaHate"", and material for acts including Sky Ferreira, Neon Jungle, Rihanna, and Gwen Stefani. In mid-2014, Charli XCX contributed the song ""Boom Clap"" to the soundtrack of the film The Fault in Our Stars. ""Boom Clap"" peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and at number six in the UK, and was certified platinum in Australia. In an interview with Popjustice in June, she stated she had finished writing sessions and expected the album to be finished by the end of July. In August, Sucker was announced to be released in October, along with the lead single ""Break the Rules"". She said the song came out about after she had made her punk album in Sweden, when she ""came out of the other side of that punk phase and translated it into something more pop."" She stated that the album was ""obviously, [...] about not giving a fuck."" The album was pushed back the next month due to the success of ""Boom Clap"", and was officially released in December 2014 in North America and February 2015 in Europe. It debuted at number 28 on the US Billboard 200, making it Charli's first album to enter the chart, and number 15 on the UK Albums Chart. The album's third single, ""Doing It"", featuring fellow British singer Rita Ora, was released in February, and peaked at number 8 on the UK Singles Chart.

Charli XCX opened for Katy Perry on the European leg of her Prismatic World Tour in early 2015, headlined her own UK tour, and featured alongside R&B artist Tinashe on rapper Ty Dolla Sign's single ""Drop That Kitty"". In May 2015, Charli XCX released ""Famous"", as the fourth single taken from Sucker. A music video was released in March, and was ranked by Time and Pitchfork as the 5th and 19th best pop music video of the year, respectively. In July and August 2015, Charli XCX co-headlined a US tour with Jack Antonoff. She announced on 21 August that, for ""personal reasons"", a planned second leg of the tour would not go ahead.In a July 2015 interview, Charli XCX said that she was working on her third album and described it as ""the most pop thing, and the most electronic thing"" she had ever done. Scottish producer Sophie, along with BloodPop and Stargate, were confirmed to be involved in the album's production. In October 2015, she premiered new song ""Vroom Vroom"" on the Beats 1 Radio Show, then claiming it would be the first song released from her third studio album. On 23 February 2016, it was announced that she had set up a new experimental pop record label, Vroom Vroom Recordings, and that she would release an EP titled Vroom Vroom on 26 February 2016. The title song was officially released that day. The second song released from the EP, titled ""Trophy"", received its first play on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 show on that night. It was also announced that she would also host her own Beats 1 show fortnightly. Vroom Vroom was produced mainly by Sophie as a teaser for her third studio album. The avant-pop EP marked a sharp shift in tone from her previous album, and was released to polarising reviews. A music video for the song ""Vroom Vroom"" was released on 22 April 2016 via Apple Music.

In July 2016, it was announced that British producer A.G. Cook, founder of record label PC Music, had signed on as Charli's creative director.

On 20 August 2017, the majority of Charli XCX's third studio album was leaked with the remainder of the tracks leaking in the following year.

She began playing the guitar at 15 years of age and attended weekend classes at the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts. When she was 16 years old, she became a global ambassador for surfwear brand Quiksilver.

O'Connor's music attracted the attention of agent Sam Bush, who signed her to a contract and arranged gigs for her in the United States. She signed a four-album recording deal with Columbia Records in late 2008, when she was 18 years old. Her debut single, ""Treasure Island"", was released in September 2011 and her debut album, For Kenny (produced by Mario Caldato Jr.), followed in November.

Cheryl (singer),"Cheryl Ann Tweedy was born in Newcastle upon Tyne on 30 June 1983, and grew up on council estates in the suburbs of Walker and Heaton. She is the fourth of five children of Joan Callaghan, and the first of her two children with Garry Tweedy following the collapse of her marriage to the father of her three other children. Cheryl's parents were together for more than a decade but never married; they separated when she was 11 years old.

At the age of seven, Cheryl appeared in a television advert for British Gas. Interested in dancing from an early age, she began sequence dancing at the age of four, and participated in a short summer holiday course at the Royal Ballet School's Summer School at the age of nine. She occasionally appeared doing dance recitals on different television shows in the UK, such as Gimme 5, in 1993.","Cheryl auditioned for the reality television show Popstars: The Rivals in 2002, which aimed to create a boy band and a girl group to compete for the Christmas number one spot on the UK Singles Chart. She sang ""Have You Ever"" in her audition, and was one of twenty contestants (ten girls and ten boys) chosen as finalists by judges Pete Waterman, Louis Walsh and Geri Halliwell. The finalists performed live on Saturday evenings, with one gender performing each week, and each week the contestant polling the fewest phone votes was eliminated, until the final line-ups of the five-piece groups emerged. Cheryl was in danger of elimination twice, surviving over Emma Beard and Aimee Kearsley in consecutive performing weeks. On 30 November 2002, she was the first contestant to qualify for the girl group, and was joined by Nadine Coyle, Sarah Harding, Nicola Roberts and Kimberley Walsh to form Girls Aloud, following the final public vote. The group's debut single ""Sound of the Underground"" peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the 2002 Christmas number one over boy band One True Voice's ""Sacred Trust / After You're Gone"". Girls Aloud hold the record for the shortest time between being formed as a band and achieving a number one single.

Girls Aloud released their debut album Sound of the Underground in May 2003, which entered the charts at number two and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) later the same year. Their singles ""I'll Stand by You"", ""Walk This Way"", and ""The Promise"" charted at number one. Two of their albums reached the top of the UK Albums Chart: their greatest hits album The Sound of Girls Aloud and 2008's Out of Control, both of which entered the chart at number one, with over one million copies of the former being sold. They also achieved seven certified albums and were nominated for five Brit Awards, winning the 2009 Best Single for ""The Promise"". The group's musical style was pop, but throughout their career they experimented with electropop and dance-pop. Girls Aloud's collaborations with Brian Higgins and his songwriting and production team Xenomania earned the group critical acclaim, due to an innovative approach to mainstream pop music. The group amassed a fortune of £30 million by May 2010. Guinness World Records listed them as ""Most Successful Reality TV Group"" in the 2007 edition. They also held the record for ""Most Consecutive Top Ten Entries in the UK by a Female Group"" in the 2008 edition, and were credited again for ""Most Successful Reality TV Group"" in the 2011 edition. The group was also named the United Kingdom's biggest selling girl group of the 21st century, with over 4.3 million singles sales and 4 million albums sold in the UK alone. Girls Aloud took a hiatus in 2009 in the pursuit of solo projects, saying they would reunite for a new studio album in 2010, but this did not materialise.In 2008, Cheryl replaced Sharon Osbourne as a judge for the fifth series of The X Factor alongside creator Simon Cowell, Dannii Minogue and Louis Walsh. She was given the girls category (made up of female solo contestants aged 16 to 25) and subsequently ended up as the winning judge when Alexandra Burke was crowned the winner of series five on 13 December. She returned for the sixth series in 2009 and was given the boys category (made up of male solo contestants aged 16 to 25). She was the winning judge for a second consecutive year when Joe McElderry won on 13 December. Cowell referred to her as ""one of the best I've ever worked with."" Cheryl returned for the seventh series in 2010 and mentored the girls category again. This was the first series in which she was not the winning mentor, when Rebecca Ferguson finished as runner-up to Matt Cardle.

In 2011, Cheryl joined Cowell, L.A. Reid, and Paula Abdul on the judging panel of the American version of The X Factor. After a three-week stint she departed the series. Cowell said the reason she left was that he offered her a place on the 2011 series of the UK version and he felt that she would have been more comfortable there. Cheryl did not return to the UK version, as Tulisa had taken her place on the UK judging panel. Nicole Scherzinger replaced her on the judging panel of the American version for the rest of season one. In December 2012, Cheryl sued the American producers of The X Factor for $2.3 million (£1.4m). She received $1.8 million (£1.1m) for the first season, and then sued for $2 million (£1.25m) for the second season, plus additional damages. In November 2013, Cheryl won for her settlement, for an undisclosed amount between her and producers Blue Orbit.

Cheryl's first solo performance was on American rapper will.i.am's ""Heartbreaker"" in 2008. She was picked to appear as a dancer in the video after taking streetdancing classes during the filming of ITV2 series The Passions of Girls Aloud. She was later asked by will.i.am to sing additional vocals on the track. In April 2009, she started working on solo material, and her debut album, 3 Words, was released in the UK on 26 October. The album spent two weeks at number one, and on 6 November, BPI certified the album platinum, denoting shipments of over 300,000 units; it later tripled this feat. The first single from the album, ""Fight for This Love"", was written by Andre Merritt, Steve Kipner and Wayne Wilkins, and produced by Kipner and Wilkins. Following a performance on The X Factor live results show, ""Fight for This Love"" entered the UK and Irish charts at number one, and in 2010, it went to number one in Denmark, Norway and Hungary, and was later certified platinum in the UK. It also became the fourth best-selling single of 2009 in the UK. Cheryl's second single, ""3 Words"", which features will.i.am, went to number four in the UK and seven in Ireland. In 2010, the single was released in Australia and charted at number five, and was certified platinum. The third single, ""Parachute"", charted in the top five in both the UK and Ireland, and was certified gold in the UK.

Cheryl started recording sessions for her second album in February 2010, though in an interview on Alan Carr: Chatty Man, she said that some of the songs submitted for the record dated back to 3 Words. The album was largely produced by Wayne Wilkins and released on 29 October 2010 under the title Messy Little Raindrops. It features guest vocals from August Rigo, Dizzee Rascal, Travie McCoy, and will.i.am, and debuted at number one in the UK, and at number two in Ireland. It received generally mixed reviews from music critics, with a positive review of four out of five stars from Jon O'Brien of AllMusic. On 19 August 2011, the album was certified platinum by BPI, with shipments in the UK exceeding 300,000. The album's first single, ""Promise This"", is an up-tempo dance-pop song written by Wilkins, Priscilla Hamilton and Christopher Jackson, which was released on 24 October 2010 and became her second number-one in the UK where it was certified gold. ""The Flood"" was released as the album's second single and entered the charts after its official release at number 18.

Cheryl was given a one-off television programme for ITV1, Cheryl Cole's Night In, which aired on 19 December 2009. The programme, hosted by Holly Willoughby, featured music and interviews with Cheryl and some of her favourite performers. Alexandra Burke, Rihanna, Will Young, Snow Patrol and will.i.am made appearances. The programme attracted 5 million viewers on its first airing.

From May to July 2010, Cheryl was the opening act for the Black Eyed Peas at the British shows (as well as some European dates) of The E.N.D. World Tour. Cheryl was interviewed during an episode of the fourth series of Piers Morgan's Life Stories, in which she discussed her marriage and divorce with Ashley Cole and her life-threatening battle with malaria. The show, which aired on 23 October 2010, drew an audience of 7.2 million, the highest figure in the chat show's history.Cheryl's third studio album, A Million Lights, was released on 18 June 2012. It debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart, selling 34,934 copies in its first week on sale, and was her first not to debut at number one in the UK and her first not to sell over 100,000 copies in its first week. Her debut album 3 Words sold 125,000 copies while its follow-up Messy Little Raindrops sold around 105,000 copies. A Million Lights was certified gold in the UK for shipments of 100,000 copies. Its lead single, ""Call My Name"" became Cheryl's third number one single on the UK Singles Chart, with the sales of 152,001 digital copies. The song became 2012's fastest selling number one single on the UK Singles Chart until December of the same year, when the winner of that year's series of The X Factor, James Arthur, sold 490,560 copies with his cover of Shontelle's ""Impossible"". ""Call My Name"" sold a total of 417,000 copies in the UK, and was the 34th best-selling single of 2012 there. ""Under the Sun"", the second single from the album, was released on 2 September 2012, and peaked at number 13, becoming her seventh consecutive solo top-twenty single. To promote A Million Lights, Cheryl embarked on her first solo concert tour, A Million Lights Tour. The tour ran from 3 to 17 October 2012, and comprised 11 show dates: two in Ireland, one in Scotland and eight in England. She also did a set of meet and greets at each concert. The £350 offer included an autograph, a chance to meet her and a photograph with her backstage, with proceeds going towards her charity, The Cheryl Cole Foundation. The meet and greet ticket drew negative criticism from fans, who complained about the high price.

On 4 June 2012, Cheryl performed a duet with Gary Barlow at the Diamond Jubilee Concert, which was organised and created by Barlow as part of the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II and watched by millions worldwide. In 2012, Cheryl returned to The X Factor as a guest mentor to help Barlow pick his contestants for the live shows of the competition. In November 2012, she was handed her own documentary entitled Cheryl: Access All Areas, which attracted 811,000 viewers on ITV2 and 177,000 on +1.

In November 2012, after months of speculation, Girls Aloud reunited for the group's 10th anniversary. On 18 November, they released their comeback single, ""Something New"", which was also the official charity single for Children in Need 2012. The single peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart. The group released their second greatest hits compilation, Ten, on 26 November 2012. The second single taken from Ten, ""Beautiful 'Cause You Love Me"", was released on 17 December. A documentary entitled Girls Aloud: Ten Years at the Top aired on ITV1 on 15 December and attracted 2.3 million viewers, a 10.5% share of the audience. In 2013, the group embarked on Ten: The Hits Tour. In March 2013, following the completion of the tour, Girls Aloud released a statement to confirm that they were splitting permanently.In June 2014, Cheryl debuted the first single from her fourth studio album Only Human, ""Crazy Stupid Love"", which features Tinie Tempah. Later in the month, she performed at Capital FM's Summertime Ball at Wembley Stadium. ""Crazy Stupid Love"" was officially released in July and entered the UK Singles Chart at number one, selling 118,000 copies. It became Cheryl's fourth number one single on the chart, making her the third British female artist to achieve four numbers ones as a solo artist, after Geri Halliwell and Rita Ora. The song also peaked at number one in Ireland. The second single from Only Human, ""I Don't Care"", was released on 2 November and similarly to its predecessor debuted at number one in the UK, becoming Cheryl's fifth number one in the country. This made her the first British female to have five solo number one singles in the UK, and she held the record for the British female solo artist with the most UK number-one singles until Jess Glynne overtook her in 2018. Only Human was released on 10 November and became Cheryl's fourth solo album to debut within the top 10 in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It was later certified silver in the UK. The album's title track was released as its third and final single in March 2015. The song, which originally peaked at number 70 as an album cut in October 2014, failed to reach the top 100 on the UK Singles Chart upon the single's release, therefore becoming Cheryl's lowest-charting single to date.

In 2014, the singer also returned as a judge on the UK version of The X Factor for its 11th series to replace Sharon Osbourne, signing a £1.5 million contract. She was joined by Simon Cowell, Louis Walsh and Mel B on the judging panel. She was again selected to mentor the girls category, with her final act Lauren Platt coming fourth. In 2015, Cheryl returned to The X Factor for its 12th series; she was joined by Cowell and new judges Ora and Nick Grimshaw. She was selected to mentor the groups category for the first time and her last remaining group Reggie 'n' Bollie reached the final finishing in second place. Cheryl announced her departure from The X Factor in April 2016, choosing to focus on her music career; she was replaced by Osbourne. She guest appeared in the show's 14th series in 2017 as Cowell's adviser during the Judges' houses stage.In July 2018, Cheryl stated that her fifth studio album was ""pretty much finished"", and revealed that she worked on the record with Naughty Boy and her former bandmate Nicola Roberts with whom she co-wrote every song. Later that year, Cheryl signed with 3 Beat to release new music, and announced that she would release a series of singles before releasing a full-length album. The first single, ""Love Made Me Do It"", was released in November 2018. Upon its release, Cheryl hinted in an interview with The Guardian that if her new material were to underperform she would retire from music. Cheryl's comeback was met with intense media scrutiny, and the single failed to make an impact in the charts peaking at number 19 in the UK and number 32 in Ireland. Her performance of the song on the 15th series of The X Factor was widely criticised in the media, with viewers arguing that its ""overtly sexual nature"" was ""inappropriate"" for pre-watershed television. The follow-up single, ""Let You"", was released in May 2019 and peaked at number 57 in the UK.

Cheryl began serving as a dance captain on the BBC One dance competition The Greatest Dancer, which premiered on 5 January 2019. In 2020, she returned for its second series, and later that year, BBC One said there were no plans to continue the show. She played music manager Coco Rayne in Sky Cinema's 2020 adaptation of the novel Four Children and It titled Four Kids and It. In August 2021, Cheryl launched a 12-part podcast about R&B music titled You, Me & R&B with Cheryl on BBC Sounds, which drew criticism for not being hosted by a black artist.

After having released no music since 2019 with the release of the single ""Let You"", Naughty Boy revealed in September 2021 that Cheryl had been working on new music with him and Roberts, stating ""Me, Cheryl and Nicola put a few songs together. They're really incredible songs, but it depends when Cheryl is ready to release it. There's definitely an album there. You can't force these things. Cheryl is a real artist. She's not one of those artists you can force.""","

Petula Clark,"In 1955 Clark became linked romantically with Joe ""Mr Piano"" Henderson. Speculation that the couple planned to marry became rife. However, with the increasing glare of the public spotlight and Clark's growing fame—her career in France was just beginning—Henderson, reportedly not wanting to end up as ""Mr. Petula Clark"", decided to end the relationship. Their professional relationship continued for a few years, culminating in the BBC Radio series Pet and Mr. Piano, the last time they worked together, although they remained on friendly terms. In 1962, he penned a ballad about their break-up, called ""There's Nothing More To Say"", for Clark's LP In Other Words. In 1967 in Las Vegas, she was witness to the wedding of her friend, French singer Charles Aznavour alongside Sammy Davis, Jr.

In October 1957 Clark was invited to appear at the Paris Olympia for the Europe N°1 live radio show Musicorama. The next day, she was invited to the office of Vogue Records' chairman Léon Cabat to discuss recording in French and working in France. There, she met her future husband, publicist Claude Wolff, to whom she was attracted immediately, and when she was told that he would work with her if she recorded in French, she agreed. They have two daughters and a son.

After picking up widespread promotional coverage in the media from The Times, the BBC, and The Guardian as a young artist to watch for in 2010, Coburn was signed to a record company; She was managed by Empire, and signed to Jive, a subsidiary of Sony Records. There was reportedly a 'bidding-war' to get Coburn to sign up to a record company. She mainly used social networking websites to broadcast her music, such as MySpace where she posted demos and her YouTube channel where the video for her song ""Daisy Dares You"" and ""Rosie"" can be found.

Tina Cousins,N/A,"Cousins' first big break was in the music industry, appearing on German DJ/producer team Sash!'s single ""Mysterious Times"" in 1998. Before ""Mysterious Times"", Cousins had released ""Killin' Time"" and ""Angel"" in March and June 1997, respectively.

Following the success of ""Mysterious Times"", she had two further UK Top 20 hits with the follow-up ""Pray"", released in November 1998, which also achieved success in the U.S., and the 1999 re-release of ""Killin' Time"". Follow-up singles ""Forever"" and the reissued ""Angel"" reached the UK Top 50 (though a published recount of the singles chart showed that ""Forever"" actually reached #38 rather than the previously published #45). Cousins turned her attention to Australia where the song, ""Forever"" achieved gold sales. ""Pray"" was also a success in Australia, reaching the Top 10 and becoming her second gold single in the ARIA Charts where it remained for more than four months.

Whilst in Australia on a promotional tour, she re-recorded her track ""Nothing to Fear"" and had it remixed by the Groove Peddlers. This became her third Australian single, and the video was also shot there.

Cousins joined Billie Piper, Cleopatra, B*Witched and Steps on the track ""Thank ABBA for the Music"", a medley of ABBA hits that they performed as a tribute at the Brit Awards. The single was released and reached the Top 10 in the UK, Republic of Ireland, Sweden, Australia and New Zealand. In 2000, she again collaborated with Sash!, on the UK Top 10 hit ""Just Around the Hill"".In 2005, Cousins released her first single in five years with ""Wonderful Life"", a cover of the Black song, which had originally been released in Australia. In 2007, ""Wonderful Life"" was adopted by Hoyts as their primary pre-feature theme music. ""Wonderful Life"" reached No. 15 in Australia and spent four months in the Top 50, becoming her biggest radio hit.

The follow-up single was ""Come to Me"". Both singles were taken from her second album Mastermind, which reached the UK and Australian Top 50. The third single to be taken from the album, ""Pretty Young Thing"", was released in two CD formats, one of which was limited to 1,000 pressings. The single reached the Australian Top 30.

Cousins made a guest appearance on Never Mind the Buzzcocks, a UK television comedy panel show, which was broadcast on 2 November 2006, in the game's Identity Parade.

During late 2006, dance format radio station WMPH became the first UK station to put any of Cousins's singles in regular rotation. In 2007, she co-wrote and performed vocals on two songs on the Main Line album by Dutch group 4 Strings. The track ""Curious"" became a Top 30 Hot Dance Airplay hit.On 7 March 2009, Cousins announced on her website that a new track had been recorded along with a film clip for a new single called ""Can't Hold Back"". This song is with Bellatrax and was released in the U.S. and the UK on Michael Gray's Eye Industries label in late summer 2009. In April 2009, Cousins announced that she had recorded a cover version of ""Sex on Fire"", originally by the Kings of Leon. The track was produced by Topham & Twigg and was released on iTunes UK on 2 September. She signed a worldwide deal with Sony Music International in September 2010, and ""Sex on Fire"" was released worldwide in autumn 2010.

The video for ""Sex on Fire"" was leaked to YouTube in October 2010. The video is most notable for its explicit scenes. The pop music blog, Popjustice, described it as ""another exercise in awful and amazing"".

From 2010 Tina also released new music with the singles ""Everlong"", "" Love Comes Back"", ""Diamonds"" and ""When Tomorrow Comes"".

In 2014 she also recorded and released a new track ""Screams"" with Kalsi and Applejack. In 2015 she also recorded a new track ""Bullet in the Gun""—remake of Planet Perfecto's late-1990s dance hit—with Probaker and Kalsi.

Cousins divides her time between Australia and the UK, performing regularly.

In November 2016, she toured Australia with the Vengaboys, Sonique, Whigfield and Joanne Accom.","Title—Album details—UK—AUS—FIN—NED—SCO—SWE—Certifications,Killing Time—* Released: July 1999 * Label: Big Records—50—23—11—69—56—41—* AUS: Gold * FIN: Gold,Mastermind—* Released: September 2005 * Label: Big Records—48,""—"" denotes items that did not chart or were not released in that territory.,Title—Year—AUS,The Remix EP—2000—81,1997—""Killin' Time""—80—16—23—Killing Time,1997—""Angel""—Killing Time,1998—""Mysterious Times"" (with Sash!)—2—62—13—8—16—11—17—28—17—* UK: Silver * BEL: Gold * FRA: Silver—Life Goes On (Sash! album),1998—""Pray""—20—8—12—10—59—34—48—23—* AUS: Gold—Killing Time,1999—""Killin' Time"" (re-release)—15—30—Killing Time,1999—""Thank ABBA for the Music"" (with Steps, Cleopatra, B*Witched and Billie)—4—9—23—5—14—6—8—* UK: Silver * AUS: Platinum * NZ: Gold—ABBAmania (ABBA tribute album),1999—""Forever""—38—14—47—* AUS: Gold—Killing Time,1999—""Angel (re-release) ""—46—Killing Time,2000—""Just Around the Hill"" (with Sash!)—8—26—37—16—55—30—60—30—Trilenium (Sash! album),2000—""Nothing to Fear""—66—Killing Time,2005—""Hymn""—Mastermind,2005—""Wonderful Life""—58—17—17—Mastermind,2005—""Come to Me""—58—14—Mastermind,2006—""Pretty Young Thing""/ ""All You Need Is Love""—27—9—Mastermind,2007—""Curious"" (with 4 Strings)—Mainline (4 Strings album),2009—""Hymn"" (with Resource)—45—Non-album singles,2009—""Can't Hold Back (with Bellatrax) ""—88—Non-album singles,2010—""Sex on Fire""—Non-album singles,2012—""When Tomorrow Comes""—Non-album singles,""—"" denotes items that did not chart or were not released in that territory.,",N/A,"an English singer, songwriter and former model",20/3/1974,1997–present,"Electronica, dance-pop, hi-NRG, dance, Eurodance, vocal trance",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Cousins
Julie Covington,"Julie Covington was born in London. Her parents were Ernest Gladden and Elsie Gladden (née Moody). Her parents divorced and her mother married Leslie Covington in 1957. She attended the girls' grammar school Brondesbury and Kilburn High School in Kilburn, northwest London. She started acting at school, and performed both acting and singing at two Edinburgh festivals. She won the first Edinburgh Festival Fringe Best Actress Award.","Covington started singing songs written by Pete Atkin and Clive James after joining the Footlights while still at teachers' training college in Cambridge. She toured North America with the Oxford and Cambridge Shakespeare Company. Covington's break came in 1967 when, as a student at Homerton College, Cambridge, she was invited to sing on David Frost's television show. After the show, she secured a recording contract with Columbia.

In 1971, she was cast in the original London production of Godspell at The Roundhouse, alongside David Essex, Jeremy Irons and Marti Webb. A recording of the production, featuring Covington's lead vocal on the track ""Day by Day"", was released in 1972. This was followed by a role in the hit Australian comedy film, ""The Adventures of Barry McKenzie"". She was then cast as Janet Weiss in the original production of The Rocky Horror Show in 1973. Between 1974 and 1984 Covington appeared regularly in the companies of the National Theatre and the Royal Court Theatre, creating such roles as Alice in Plenty, Vivienne Eliot in Tom & Viv (for which she received an Olivier Award nomination) and Edward in the original production of Caryl Churchill's Cloud Nine.

During the early 1970s, she appeared and sang on the children's television programme Play Away. She starred in the BBC's 1975 Christmas production Great Big Groovy Horse, a rock opera based on the story of the Trojan Horse shown on BBC2. It was later repeated on BBC1 in 1977 1976 and 1977 saw her appearing in both series of the primetime British television programme, Rock Follies. In 1976, the composer Andrew Lloyd Webber saw her perform in cabaret, and recognising her from Rock Follies, suggested to lyricist Tim Rice that she might be the actress to play the title role in their original studio recording of their musical Evita. The singer Elkie Brooks had previously turned down an offer. Covington's recording of the song ""Don't Cry for Me Argentina"" reached No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart in February 1977. Later offered the opportunity to originate the role in the stage production of Evita, she declined, which led to Elaine Paige being cast. Speaking in 1985, Covington expressed some regret at this decision, but explained that she did not like Eva Peron and that without some positive feeling for the person she had preferred to turn the role down.

As Evita opened in 1978, she instead appeared with the English National Opera as Anna in The Seven Deadly Sins. Paige's successor in Evita, Marti Webb later also played Anna in the ENO's production of The Seven Deadly Sins.

In 1978, Covington performed the role of Beth, wife of Parson Nathaniel (Phil Lynott), on the recording of ""The Spirit of Man"" from Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds.

Covington achieved chart success with a cover version of Alice Cooper's ""Only Women Bleed"" which reached No. 12 on the UK Singles Chart. It is included on reissiues of her eponymous 1978 album.

After recording a second solo album and guesting on other artists' albums she returned to the theatre, starring in the 1982 National Theatre production of Guys and Dolls, playing Sister Sarah opposite Ian Charleson's Sky Masterson. Russell Davies said that her performance ""is of such a special timbre that she isn't easily matched.""

In 1989 she took part in a British television special with Colm Wilkinson, Carol Woods and Paul Jones called Let's Face the Music of Lennon and McCartney. Her solo performances of ""If I Fell"" and ""In My Life"" are available on YouTube.",N/A,"

Joy Crookes,"Joy Elizabeth Akther Crookes was born in the Lambeth district of South London on 9 October 1998 to a Bangladeshi-Bengali mother from Dhaka and an Irish father from Dublin. She grew up in Elephant and Castle, where she spent eight years at a Catholic state primary school. Crookes gained interest in singing after attending a jazz and blues workshop and, by the age of 13, had started publishing covers of Laura Marling and reggae to YouTube. Whilst a teenager, Crookes taught herself how to play guitar, piano and bass, before writing her own music. When aged 14, her parents separated, and she moved with her mother to Ladbroke Grove. In April 2013, Crookes uploaded a cover of ""Hit the Road Jack"" by Ray Charles to YouTube at the age of 14. The video gained the attention of over 600,000 viewers, notably including her current manager a few months later.","At the age of 17, Crookes released her debut single ""New Manhattan"" in February 2016, as well as ""Sinatra"" in August 2016, and ""Bad Feeling"" in June 2017. ""New Manhattan"" is a love song that was named after the area in Brussels. M Magazine wrote about Crookes at the start of her career, stating, ""[She] may not be out of school yet, but what she lacks in experience she certainly makes up for in sonic dexterity."" When describing the aesthetic in Crookes' debut music video for ""Sinatra"", Pip Williams from Line of Best Fit wrote, ""much like [her] sound, [the video] blurs the classic with the contemporary, blanketing the listener in nostalgia whilst teasing them with hints of something brand new.""

Crookes released her debut EP, Influence, with Speakerbox and Insanity Records in July 2017. The five-track EP lasts less than 20 minutes and features ""Sinatra"", ""Bad Feeling"", ""New Manhattan"", ""Mother May I Sleep With Danger?"" and ""Power"". Crookes performed ""Mother May I Sleep With Danger?"" along with her guitar player Charles J Monneraud on the global music platform, COLORS, in December 2017. As of November 2019, the video gained over eight million views on YouTube. She told BBC that she wrote the song by herself on New Year's Day of 2017 and began playing the song on tour, stating ""When you tour a song you get to know it - you stay over at its house, you meet its mum, you get to know the sibling it doesn't like. So by the time we did Colors, it was a walk in the park. The video really changed everything. For about six months after that, everywhere I went people would say, 'Are you Joy from Colors?'""Crookes released the single ""Don't Let Me Down"" with an accompanying music video in November 2018, before releasing her second EP, Reminiscence, in January 2019. Clare O'Shea from The Line of Best Fit described the EP as ""a collection of five distinct tracks melding pop, R&B and soul."" The EP features ""Man's World"", ""Lover Don't"", ""Don't Let Me Down"", ""For a Minute"" as well as the song ""Two Nights"", which was added to the BBC Radio 1 playlist in February 2019. Crookes made her first appearance in Vogue in March 2019, before releasing the singles ""Since I Left You"": ""a hauntingly stripped back break-up song,"" as well as ""London Mine"" in April 2019. ""The song celebrates the invisible people and how London belongs to no one but everyone,"" Crookes told The Line of Best Fit about ""London Mine"". ""It's a celebration of immigrants who make up this country.""

Crookes performed on the Introducing Stage at BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend in May 2019, before releasing her third EP, Perception, on the eve of June 2019. The five-track EP features ""Hurts"", ""No Hands"", ""London Mine"", ""Since I Left You"" and ""Darkest Hour"". Crookes made her first Glastonbury Festival appearance in June 2019. In September 2019, Crookes self-produced released ""Yah / Element"" a medley of ""Yah"" and ""Element"" by Kendrick Lamar, before announcing her sold-out headlining tour of Europe for October 2019. She released the single ""Early"" with Irish hip-hop artist Jafaris in early October, which later went on to reach No. 1 on the UK Asian chart. Crookes made her debut television appearance when she performed ""Early"" with Jafaris on Later... with Jools Holland in November 2019. Crookes made an appearance on the Irish music TV series Other Voices in November 2019. Crookes was shortlisted for Rising Star Award at the 2020 Brit Awards. She was placed fourth in Sound of 2020, an annual BBC poll of 170 music critics who predict breakthrough acts for the coming year. Crookes was praised her for her ""South London stories filled with wit and romance"".In April 2020, Crookes released her first single of 2020, ""Anyone But Me"", which debuted atop the UK Asian Top 40. The song is about her battles with mental health and how she feels that ""there's another person living in [her] head."" In September 2020, Crookes released a cover version of The Wannadies' 1994 single ""You & Me Song"", which was featured in an O2 TV advertisement, consequently entering both the UK Singles Downloads and the UK Singles Sales charts. Crookes released the single ""Feet Don't Fail Me Now"" in June 2021, which became her third single to top the UK Asian Top 40 and is featured on the EASports video game FIFA 22 It served as the lead single from her debut album, Skin, which she revealed alongside the release of its title track in August 2021. Its third single, ""When You Were Mine"", was released later that month and became her fourth-ever single to top the UK Asian Top 40.

In April 2007 her Drusilla, in The Coronation of Poppea with English National Opera was described as ""feisty"". Also in 2007 she joined ENO in David McVicar's staging of Handel's Agrippina where her ""beguiling"" Poppea was described as ""the most exciting discovery ... rendered the more so by her frequent stripteases."" In April 2012 she performed for the first time the part of Gilda in Verdi's Rigoletto at the Royal Opera, stepping in at short notice on a recommendation by conductor John Eliot Gardiner. In May and June 2013 she performed the title role of Leoš Janáček's The Cunning Little Vixen at the Glyndebourne Festival. A review noted: ""The action is dominated by Lucy Crowe's Vixen, a powerhouse of foxy ingenuity, her tail switching saucily while her light and easy soprano floats through Janáček's sometimes treacherous lines."" In 2013 she sang Gilda again at the Deutsche Oper Berlin, conducted by Roberto Rizzi Brignoli. In 2014 she sang Adina in Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore at the Royal Opera. In 2015 Crowe performed in Couperin's Leçons des ténèbres at the Spitalfields Festival. Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Jonathan McAloon said: Singing the first of the three Leçons, Crowe’s acclaim as an international opera star was evident in her command of dynamics and characterisation; the purity of her higher register was offset by the tormented, near faltering effect she produced in the lower passages.

Lynne Dawson,"Born in York and growing up in Yorkshire, Dawson fully expected to continue the farming tradition of her family, and indeed singing was not her first career; she first worked in industry as a translator. However, later she studied at both the Guildhall School of Music and Britten–Pears School in Suffolk, where her teachers included Rae Woodland, Gerald Moore and Peter Pears. Her time as a music student, however, was limited as she soon obtained enough professional work to embark upon a career and made her operatic debut in 1986 as the Countess in Le Nozze di Figaro (Kent Opera). Dawson's position as one of England's most versatile and popular sopranos was confirmed by her performance as a soloist in ""Libera me"" from Verdi's Requiem with the BBC Singers at the Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales in September 1997. She still continues a busy musical schedule, is head of vocal and opera studies at the Royal Northern College of Music (RNCM) as well as the University of York and is a Professor of Leeds College of Music.",N/A,N/A,N/A,English soprano,3/5/1953,N/A,N/A,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynne_Dawson

Inspired by The Clash and The Sex Pistols, she formed her first band, The Safety Pinz, when she was seven years old. She later posted a mash-up of her own music with Beyoncé’s ""Mine"" to YouTube, which attracted the attention of producer Mickey Valen, and she subsequently saved up enough money to relocate to London to pursue a career in music. Devine adopted L Devine as her artist moniker because she shares the name Olivia Devine with a porn star.","Devine released her debut single ""School Girls"" in July 2017. In an interview with Nylon, she said that the song is about ""how in the 'real world’, you still encounter the same bitchiness you thought you left behind at school."" The accompanying lyric video for the track was made in collaboration with British designer and producer Chloe. She subsequently released an acoustic session performance of the track, which was premiered by The 405. In November 2017, Devine released her debut five-track EP Growing Pains, which was accompanied by a ten-minute visual that was directed by Emil Nava, who had previously collaborated with Rihanna and Selena Gomez. The majority of the film was shot in Newcastle.

Devine's second EP, Peer Pressure, was released on 16 November 2018 along with a short film, also directed by Emil Nava. ""Peer Pressure"", the lead single, opens with a line from the 1988 film Heathers, and Devine spoke about her love of the coming-of-age film in an interview with The Line of Best Fit. Devine counts Charli XCX among her fans, and Charli's backing vocals feature on the track ""Peer Pressure"" after producer Justin Raisen played it to the pop star, who asked to record a version of it.

Agyness Deyn,"Born Laura Michelle Hollins, Deyn is from Littleborough, near Rochdale in Greater Manchester. Deyn later moved to Failsworth near Oldham. The second of three children, she moved to Rossendale, Lancashire, and attended All Saints Roman Catholic High School, as well as Bacup and Rawtenstall Grammar School and Sixth Form, Waterfoot.

Deyn's name was apparently coined to further her modelling career after she consulted her mother's friend, a numerology expert, who advised her of the most 'fortuitous' way to spell the name 'Agnes'. It was reported that her mother Lorraine (a nurse), and her sister Emily both changed their surname to Deyn, while Lorraine has changed the I in her first name to Y.

Deyn's working life started at a fish and chip shop in Stubbins, Rossendale, where she was a part-time server at the age of 13. Even at an early age she had an eye for style and by 17 she had already had her head shaved. ""I've had short hair since I was 13, and when I was 17, I had a skinhead."" In 1999, she won the Rossendale Free Press ""Face of '99"" competition, aged just 16.

She then moved to London, working in a fast-food restaurant during the day and a bar at night.","Deyn's biography claims that she was ""spotted"" while shopping with fashion designer Henry Holland in Kentish Town, London. She then signed with SELECT Model Management.

In May 2007, she was featured on the cover of American Vogue, alongside Doutzen Kroes, Caroline Trentini, Raquel Zimmermann, Sasha Pivovarova, Jessica Stam, Coco Rocha, Hilary Rhoda, Chanel Iman and Lily Donaldson as ""The World's Next Top Models.""

In June 2009, the Daily Mirror reported that Deyn had quit modeling to spend more time with her then boyfriend, singer-songwriter Miles Kane.

Vogue Paris described her as one of the top 30 models of the 2000s. Deyn appeared in the May 2011 British Vogue editorial, photographed by Tim Walker.

In October 2012, Deyn once again announced that she has retired from modeling in an interview with The Independent. She stated, ""I suppose I have stopped modeling officially. I've not done any for a good long while now. I think it was about four years ago when my feelings were changing towards the industry. I didn't hate it, but I was yearning to do something different. I was on a gradient. It was a gradual thing."" She intends to focus on her acting career.Deyn provides vocals for the single ""Who"" by Five O'Clock Heroes as well as featuring in the video. The single was poorly received by NME, who gave it only a 2/10. The single charted at No. 109 in the UK. Until recently she was a member of the now defunct group Lucky Knitwear.

Hannah Diamond,N/A,"Diamond met GFOTY through a friend, and GFOTY introduced her to A. G. Cook. After a vocalist failed to show up to a session with Cook, the two worked on their first musical collaboration. In 2012, they recorded Diamond's first solo song, titled ""Attachment"". Diamond released her debut single ""Pink and Blue"" through PC Music in October 2013. The song resembles a lullaby, with a harshly synthetic quality. The attention received by ""Pink and Blue"" helped to introduce the fledgling label, and it placed 5th on Facts list of ""The 100 best tracks of the decade so far"".

The following January, Diamond appeared on A. G. Cook's ""Keri Baby"". The song toyed with the idea of Diamond as an MP3 file or a digital entity on a screen. Diamond made her first live performance in April, at Basement in London. She released ""Attachment"" as her second single later that month. ""Attachment"" is a melancholy ballad about modern relationships, with a high-pitched melody backed by farcical harmonies.

Diamond's third solo single ""Every Night"" was released in November 2014 and became PC Music's first single available through the iTunes Store. The song discusses feelings of desire and showcases a more bold personality than Diamond's earlier songs. Her vocals are childlike and staccato, supported by ""oh-ooh-oh"" harmonies. The production drew comparisons to La Bouche and ""Call Me Maybe"" by Carly Rae Jepsen. ""Every Night"" received nearly 200,000 plays on SoundCloud within two weeks, and it became Diamond's first song to appear on a Billboard chart, reaching 28th on the Emerging Artists chart.

March 2015 saw Diamond head to the US to play the PC Music showcase at the Empire Garage in Austin, Texas as part of SXSW. Her performance was very well received with The Guardian calling it a ""well-crafted performance, as much about the aesthetic and choreography as the camp songs"" and according to Flavorwire was the one ""who impressed the most."" On 8 May 2015, Diamond performed as part of a PC Music show at BRIC House in Brooklyn, New York as part of the Red Bull Music Academy Festival. The show was billed as the premiere of Pop Cube, ""a multimedia reality network"". In November 2015, Diamond released her song ""Hi"" with a music video made in conjunction with i-D magazine. After having the resources to produce her first music video, she selected ""Hi"" as a ""way of tying up my older material, and a good way of introducing my next phase"". Diamond had begun recording a full-length album, originally planned for release in 2015.February 2016 saw Hannah Diamond collaborate with Charli XCX on a new track titled ""Paradise"", which featured on XCX's Vroom Vroom EP, the first release on XCX's label Vroom Vroom Recordings. According to the singer, the label will combine her ""love for bubblegum pop with mystery and darkness."" In October that year, Diamond released the new single ""Fade Away"" with a lyric video via PC Music. On 22 December 2016, Diamond released a free single, ""Make Believe"", which was produced by easyFun and A.G. Cook.

It was made available on YouTube for streaming with a link to a ZIP file of the mix in the description. On 16 November 2018, Diamond released ""True"", which is the lead single from her debut album Reflections.

With this release, she also announced the release date for Reflections and revealed the album artwork. On 13 November, Diamond released another single leading up to the release of her album, titled ""Love Goes On"". The song was released with an accompanying music video.

On 31 October 2019, she announced her first headlining tour ""The Invisible Tour"" and added new dates on 1 November 4 and 28 November 2019. The tour began on 4 December 2019.

Dido (singer),"Dido was born Florian Cloud de Bounevialle Armstrong, at St. Mary Abbot's Hospital in Kensington, on Christmas Day in 1971. As she was born on Christmas Day, she also celebrates an ""official birthday"" on 25 June, following the example of Paddington Bear. Her mother, Clare (née Collins), is a poet of French ancestry, and her father, William O'Malley Armstrong (1938–2006), was an Irish publisher and former managing director of Sidgwick & Jackson. Her elder brother, Rowland Constantine O'Malley Armstrong, is better known as record producer Rollo, part of the British electronica trio Faithless.

Despite their birth names, the pair were known from childhood by the names Dido and Rollo. Dido considers hers as her real name, not simply a stage name or nickname. As a child, she had to deal with her birth name's ambiguous and unusual nature, which led to her being bullied and even to her pretending to have an ordinary name. In a 2001 interview, she said ""To be called one thing and christened another is actually very confusing and annoying. It's one of the most irritating things that my parents did to me. ... Florian is a German man's name. That's just mean. To give your child a whole lot of odd names. They were all so embarrassing. ... I thought it was cruel to call me Dido and then expect me to just deal with it."" The name ""Dido"" derives from the legendary Queen of Carthage.

Dido was educated at Thornhill Primary School in Islington, Dallington School, City of London Girls' and Westminster School, where she was taught by the contemporary musician and Head of Academic Music, Sinan Savaskan. After she stole a recorder from school at the age of five, her parents enrolled her at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. By the time she reached her teens, she had learned to play the piano, recorder, and the violin. She later studied law at Birkbeck, University of London, while working as a literary agent. She never completed the degree, deciding instead to take up music full-time.","In 1995, Dido began recording 10 demo tracks which were put together on a collection entitled Odds & Ends and sent out by Nettwerk management. Nettwerk had signed her after she was brought to their attention by her collaborations with Faithless, the UK dance act spearheaded by her brother, Rollo Armstrong (Dido co-wrote and provided vocals for album tracks, such as ""Flowerstand Man"" and ""Hem of His Garment""). The collection was released by Nettwerk on CD-R acetate in 1995 and featured a mixture of finished productions and demo versions which she later considered for release on her 1999 debut album, No Angel. Odds & Ends brought her to the attention of A&R Peter Edge at Arista Records, who signed her in the US in late 1996, and negotiated a co-sign deal with her brother's independent record label, Cheeky Records. Of the tracks included on Odds & Ends, ""Take My Hand"" was included on all editions of No Angel as a bonus track; ""Sweet Eyed Baby"" was remixed and renamed to ""Don't Think of Me"", while ""Worthless"" and ""Me"" were released exclusively on the Japanese edition. Peter Leak became Dido's manager during the recording of No Angel after Edge played some of the in-progress recordings and been ""blown away"" by them.Cheeky Records, to which Dido was signed, was sold to BMG records in 1999. This delayed the release of the album No Angel in the United Kingdom, but also allowed her to concentrate on promoting No Angel in the United States, including a slot on Sarah McLachlan's Lilith Fair tour. Through touring, both before and after the album was available, Dido's music began to receive more exposure. The first official single chosen by Dido and her label, ""Here with Me"", initially struggled to make an impact on radio, but while the label were considering switching to an alternative track, the song made a breakthrough as a result of its use in television programme Roswell. The song was used as the theme music of the show, but it was actually when it was played in its entirety during the season finale that it really made an impact with audiences.

Manager Peter Leak told HitQuarters that sales jumped from 2,000 to 9,000 units during the week of the show's transmission. Arguably it was this, as well as the airplay on MTV throughout Europe of the single's video, which brought her mass attention. Subsequently, the song was used in the British romantic comedy Love Actually. In 1998, the music producer for the film Sliding Doors picked her track ""Thank You"" for the soundtrack. No Angel was released in 1999, and Dido toured extensively to promote the record.

American rapper Eminem helped introduce Dido to a US audience in 2000 when he received permission from Dido herself to sample the first verse of ""Thank You"" in his hit single ""Stan"". Dido also appeared in the music video as Stan's pregnant girlfriend. She did not want to do the video at first, as she was uncomfortable with the scene in the video where she had to be tied up and have her mouth covered with duct tape, but later agreed to it and got along well with Eminem and the crew on set. In North America, the video usually aired with the trunk scene censored. Interest soared in her debut album, leading it to hit charts in Europe on import sales alone, charting in the top five on the UK Albums Chart before its official UK re-release.

No Angel went on to become the top-selling album of 2001 worldwide, debuting at, and returning to, number one in the official UK Albums Chart many times throughout the year. It spawned two top ten hit singles, ""Here with Me"" and ""Thank You"", a further top twenty hit, ""Hunter"" and a fourth and final single release ""All You Want"" which reached the top 25. It was certified platinum in over thirty-five countries, and is estimated to have sold over 21 million copies worldwide. Dido's widely emulated hairstyle at this time became known as the ""Dido flip"". Her sold-out worldwide tour featured hip-hop artist Pete Miser as her live band's DJ. No Angel claimed No. 97 according to the Decade-end Album Chart by Billboard.Life for Rent was released in 2003. Preceded by the hit single ""White Flag"", the album sold over 152,000 copies in the first day alone in the UK, and went on to sell over 400,000 in the first week. Three further singles—""Life for Rent"", ""Don't Leave Home"" and ""Sand in My Shoes""—were lifted from the album, with Dido embarking on a worldwide tour in support of the album (a DVD of footage from the tour was released in 2005 entitled Live at Brixton Academy).

Following her sold-out world tour of 2004, Dido was asked to perform at three of the Live 8 concerts on 2 July 2005—performing in London, then at the Eden Project in Cornwall, before flying over to Paris, performing both solo (""White Flag"") and duetting with Youssou N'Dour (""Thank You"" and ""Seven Seconds"").

Also in 2005, Dido provided vocals for her brother's side project Dusted on the album Safe from Harm. She sings on the tracks: ""Time Takes Time"", ""Hurt U"" and ""Winter"" and she co-wrote three tracks on the album: ""Always Remember to Respect & Honour Your Mother, Part 1"", ""The Biggest Fool in the World"" and ""Winter"".Dido's third album, Safe Trip Home, was released in November 2008. The album, which Dido began work on in October 2005, was produced by Jon Brion and Dido herself and features contributions from Brian Eno, Questlove, Mick Fleetwood, Rollo Armstrong, and Matt Chamberlain. Recording sessions were held at London's Abbey Road and at Jon Brion's home studio in Los Angeles. During production of the album, Dido attended evening classes in music and English at the University of California, Los Angeles. The first single from the album, ""Don't Believe in Love"", was released in October 2008, and a track titled ""Look No Further"" was made available to download from her official website for a limited time. The album failed to sell as well as No Angel or Life for Rent, and Dido opted not to tour in support of the album due to her difficulties with performing the material that was written about the death of her father. It was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical.

In December 2008, Dido's Safe Trip Home song ""Let's Do the Things We Normally Do"", was criticised by Gregory Campbell, MP for East Londonderry and Minister for Sports, Arts and Leisure for Northern Ireland, for referencing lyrics from a song, ""The Men Behind the Wire"", which was written in the aftermath of the introduction of detention without trial for persons accused of being members of paramilitary groups. Campbell described ""The Men Behind the Wire"" as ""written about people who were murderers, arsonists and terrorists"", and suggested ""she [Dido] should clarify her position so that her fans and the wider public knows where she stands on these things"". The album's artwork features a photograph of astronaut Bruce McCandless II during a spacewalk, as part of space shuttle mission STS-41-B; McCandless sued Dido, Sony Music Entertainment, and Getty Images Inc for unauthorised use of this photo in September 2010. The case was settled under undisclosed terms on 14 January 2011.Shortly after the release of Safe Trip Home, Dido returned to the studio to start recording new material for inclusion on her fourth studio album. In July 2009, Dido said that the album would have an electronic approach, in an attempt to take it in a totally different direction to her previous albums. In September 2010, Dido released the single ""Everything to Lose"" via digital download, following its appearance on the soundtrack of the film Sex and the City 2 (released in May 2010).

In January 2011, Dido released ""If I Rise"", a collaboration with producer A.R. Rahman, for which an official music video was released. ""If I Rise"" was written for 127 Hours, a thriller film directed by Danny Boyle. The soundtrack features a mix of electric guitars with orchestral arrangements and sound loops, and ""If I Rise"" is featured in the climax of the film. The song was nominated for Satellite Award, Houston Film Critics Society Awards and Las Vegas Film Critics Society Award, as well as the 83rd Academy Award for Original Song. It won the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Song.

Dido's fourth album, Girl Who Got Away, was released by Sony Music Entertainment in March 2013. ""No Freedom"" was released as the album's lead single in January 2013. The album was recorded in London and California and features production from Rollo Armstrong, Sister Bliss, Lester Mendez, A. R. Rahman, Rick Nowels, Greg Kurstin, Brian Eno, and Jeff Bhasker. Dido appeared on the second series of televised singing competition The Voice UK in May 2013, serving as an advisor to coach Danny O'Donoghue during the show's battle rounds.

In November 2013, Dido released the album Greatest Hits, a compilation of previous material and remixes that also included a new track, ""NYC"". The release of Greatest Hits completed Dido's contractual obligations with RCA Records, and she spoke of her plans to release her music independently. By late 2013, she was writing material for a fifth studio album.Dido signed to BMG to release her fifth album in early 2019. Dido worked with her brother and long-time collaborator Rollo Armstrong, along with Rick Nowels and Ryan Louder. On 9 November 2018, Dido announced her new album's title, Still on My Mind, along with its cover. It was released on 8 March 2019 and charted at number 3 on the UK Albums chart, number 1 on the UK Indie Album chart and sold over 60,000 copies in the UK. The teaser single ""Hurricanes"" was released on 12 November 2018. The official lead single ""Give You Up"" was premiered 22 January 2019 on BBC Radio 2. The single peaked at number 32 on the UK Singles Download chart. It peaked at number 1 on the US Dance Club Songs chart. ""Give You Up"" was followed by edited versions of ""Take You Home"" (released 5 April 2019) and ""Friends"" (released 22 July 2019) as singles. Dido toured in support of the album from May 2019, making it her first world tour in 15 years. The deluxe edition of the album was released on 15 November 2019 but failed to chart, despite the release of another single, ""Just Because"".

In October 2019, Dido was featured on her brother Rollo's The Last Summer album, which was released under the alias ""R Plus"". The album charted at number 96 on the UK Album Sales Chart.","

Michelle Dockery,"Dockery is the daughter of Lorraine, a care home assistant from Stepney, and Michael Dockery, a lorry driver who latterly became a surveyor. Her father is Irish. She grew up in Romford, in London and she still has traces of an Estuary accent. She says, ""I'll never sound like Lady Mary, although my Essex accent has softened over the years. But it comes back if I've had a couple of drinks or if I am around my family"".

Dockery has two older sisters, Louise and Joanne. She was educated first at Chadwell Heath Academy, and later at the Finch Stage School.

Dockery confirmed in a 2017 interview with Parade that if you asked her parents when she began performing they would answer that it was when she was two or three years old. “I wanted to entertain from such a young age, doing impersonations and putting on plays with my sisters,” says Dockery. “I always had it in me and loved it.” She remembers being nine and performing for family members when they came to visit.

After her A Levels, she enrolled at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama, where she was awarded the gold medal for Drama at her graduation in 2004.","Dockery was a member of the National Youth Theatre. She made her professional debut in His Dark Materials at the Royal National Theatre in 2004.

Eliza Doolittle (singer),"Eliza Doolittle was born in Westminster, London. She comes from a family with a successful and varied musical background. Her father is John Caird, a stage director and writer of plays, musicals and operas who is also an honorary associate director of the Royal Shakespeare Company.

Her paternal grandfather G. B. Caird, was the theologian and principal of Mansfield College, Oxford. Her mother is musical theatre actress and model artist Frances Ruffelle, who won a Tony Award for her role of Éponine in the English-language version of Les Misérables. Doolittle is the granddaughter of Sylvia Young, founder of the eponymous theatre school. She has a younger brother. Her parents divorced when she was four years old.

Doolittle grew up in Highgate and attended Channing School For Girls, Bedales School,   and Westminster Kingsway College. She was used to being around stages and seeing her mother singing and had always wanted to become a recording artist. She chose the stage name of Eliza Doolittle, the Pygmalion and My Fair Lady character, because it was her nickname as a child.

Eliza had a brief career on stage playing Young Cosette in Les Misérables in London's West End in 1996–1997. Her parents had met and began their relationship during the original production when her father was the co-director and her mother played Eponine.

Julie Driscoll,N/A,"Driscoll is known for her 1960s versions of Bob Dylan and Rick Danko's ""This Wheel's on Fire"", and Donovan's ""Season of the Witch"", both with Brian Auger and the Trinity. Along with the Trinity, she was featured prominently in the 1969 television special 33⅓ Revolutions per Monkee, singing ""I'm a Believer"" in a soul style with Micky Dolenz. She and Auger had previously worked in Steampacket, with Long John Baldry and Rod Stewart.

""This Wheel's on Fire"" reached number five in the United Kingdom in June 1968, number 13 in Canada, and Bubbled Under the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States at #106 that August. With distortion, the imagery of the title and the group's dress and performance, this version came to represent the psychedelic era in British rock music. Driscoll recorded the song again in the early 1990s with Adrian Edmondson as the theme to the BBC comedy series Absolutely Fabulous.

Since the 1970s, Driscoll has concentrated on experimental vocal music. She married jazz musician Keith Tippett and collaborated with him and now uses the name Julie Tippetts, adopting the original spelling of her husband's surname. She took part in Keith Tippett's big band Centipede, and sang in Robert Wyatt's Theatre Royal Drury Lane concert in 1974. She released a solo album, Sunset Glow, in 1975; was lead vocalist on Carla Bley's album Tropic Appetites; and performed on John Wolf Brennan's ""HeXtet"".

Later in the 1970s, she toured with her own band and recorded and performed as one of the vocal quartet Voice, with Maggie Nichols, Phil Minton, and Brian Eley.

In the early 1980s, Julie Tippetts was a guest vocalist on an early single by pop-jazz band Working Week, on the song ""Storm of Light"", which brought them to the attention of a wider audience. Between 2009 and 2015, she recorded four albums with Martin Archer.","Below is a selected list of Driscoll's work, sorted mostly by recording date:

Sophie Ellis-Bextor,"Ellis-Bextor was born in London to Janet Ellis, who was a presenter on BBC's children's television programmes Blue Peter and Jigsaw, and Robin Bextor, a film producer and director: they separated when she was four. As a child, Ellis-Bextor occasionally appeared on Blue Peter alongside her mother, who presented the programme.

She attended St. Stephen's School and later the independent Godolphin and Latymer School in Hammersmith. Among her earliest public performances were with the W11 Opera children's opera from the age of thirteen, and she is now a patron of the organisation.

Ellis-Bextor has said ""I didn't see myself as a good-looking girl and that was good, because I didn't rely on it.... I've now found lots of like-minded weirdos so it's OK.""","Ellis-Bextor began her professional musical career in 1996, singing lead vocals in indie band Theaudience. The band released four singles, including the UK Top 40 hits ""I Know Enough (I Don't Get Enough)"", and ""A Pessimist Is Never Disappointed"", and one self-titled album (theaudience (1999)). Videos for the band's singles were directed by her father, Robin Bextor. While in Theaudience, readers of Melody Maker voted Ellis-Bextor number one in a poll of 'most sexy people in rock'.

The band split in 1999 after demos for a planned second album were rejected by their label Mercury Records, who then dropped the band. Ellis-Bextor recorded a duet with Manic Street Preachers — ""Black Holes for the Young"" — as a B-side for their 1998 single ""The Everlasting"", and in 1999, made an appearance on the Departure Lounge album Out of Here.After Theaudience split, Ellis-Bextor took a year off from singing. In 2000, she collaborated with Italian DJ Spiller, adding vocals to his track ""Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)"". It entered the UK charts at number one, just beating former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham on her first solo track. ""Groovejet"" won several awards: No. 1, Pop Top 20; No. 1, ILR; No. 1, Radio 1; No. 8, top dance track of 2000 and single of the year in Melody Maker. In the Metro Newspaper, it received ninth place in the contest for the Greatest No. 1 of all time. In 2000, it was a finalist in The Record of the Year. In that same year, it won the awards for Best Single and Best Ibiza Tune at the Ericsson Muzik Awards.

In 2001, Ellis-Bextor released her début album, Read My Lips. It reached number two on the UK charts and spawned four top-twenty hit singles. Her rework of Cher's ""Take Me Home"" reached number two, as did ""Murder on the Dancefloor"", which became Ellis-Bextor's biggest single and was on charts for twenty-three weeks. ""Murder on the Dancefloor"" became Europe's most played song of 2002. In 2002, Read My Lips was re-released with two new songs (and a live version of ""Groovejet"") and Ellis-Bextor won the Recording Artist Award at that year's Showbusiness Awards. Her third single, ""Get Over You / Move This Mountain"", was released in June 2002 and reached number three. The fourth single, ""Music Gets the Best of Me"", rose to number fourteen in December. At the beginning of 2002, Ellis-Bextor was nominated for the ""British Female Solo Artist"" BRIT Award, going on to be nominated for a further two consecutive years.Her second album, Shoot from the Hip, was released in October 2003 and yielded two further top-ten singles, ""Mixed Up World"" and ""I Won't Change You"". The album reached number 19 on the UK charts and was certified silver by the BPI for shipments of 60,000. Ellis-Bextor described the album as ""more emotionally direct"" and ""a little more left-of-centre at times"" than Read My Lips—""It has more of a live feel [...] It's still a pop album—with elements of disco, indie and rock."" She opted to step back from promotion of the album after becoming pregnant.

In 2005, Ellis-Bextor was featured on the Busface single ""Circles (Just My Good Time)"" under the alias Mademoiselle E.B.

Trip the Light Fantastic, Ellis-Bextor's third album, was released in May 2007 and reached number seven in the UK. The album produced three singles: ""Catch You"" (number 8 in the UK), ""Me and My Imagination"" (number 23), and ""Today the Sun's on Us"" (number 64). The song ""If I Can't Dance"" was announced as a single but later retracted.

Ellis-Bextor supported George Michael on his UK tour leg in June 2007. Her own UK tour, the Trip the Light Fantastic Tour, was due to start in August 2007, but it was postponed after Ellis-Bextor was invited to be the ""special guest"" on Take That's Beautiful World Tour, which commenced in October 2007. Ellis-Bextor stated that her tour would be rescheduled for March 2008, with all tickets purchased being valid for the rescheduled concerts. The tour was never rescheduled, and Ellis-Bextor subsequently refused to discuss the issue in interviews. In October 2008, Ellis-Bextor sang at the Keep the Promise Rally in Trafalgar Square to end Child Poverty.In June 2009, Ellis-Bextor was featured on the Freemasons single ""Heartbreak (Make Me a Dancer)"", which reached number 13 in the UK.

The singer's fourth album, Make a Scene, was released in June 2011 following a year-long delay, during which she left her label Universal Music Group to establish her own label, EBGBs. Ellis-Bextor said that her decision to leave Universal was spurred on by the departure of the head of Fascination Records, the sub-label to which she was signed, following the release of ""Bittersweet"". Ellis-Bextor described Make a Scene as ""very much [a dance album]—more so than any of my other albums."" Ellis-Bextor said she was planning an ""album that's really different [...] but I think this album [Make a Scene] is a good way to bow out of the dance sound for now. I think it's finishing on a high."" She supported Pet Shop Boys on the UK leg of their Pandemonium Tour in July 2010. She worked with Calvin Harris, Richard X, Dimitri Tikovoi, Hannah Robinson, Metronomy, and Liam Howe from the Sneaker Pimps. ""Off & On"" preceded the release of the album in continental Europe and Russia, where the album was released by Universal Music Russia; in the UK, the single ""Starlight"" was released ahead of the album in May 2011.

Ellis-Bextor supported synth-pop band Erasure on their Total Pop! Forest tour of woodland locations in the UK in June 2011. She resumed touring internationally in 2011, playing venues such as Jakarta's SoulNation festival, as well as returning to Australia by performing in Sydney and Melbourne. Ellis-Bextor collaborated with French DJ Bob Sinclar on a track titled ""Fuck with You"" (released in November 2011), which was included on his album Disco Crash and was a huge club hit in Continental Europe. Ellis-Bextor's collaboration with French DJ Mathieu Bouthier, ""Beautiful"", was released in July 2012 in France.In May 2011, she revealed that she had begun work on her fifth album. Beginning in 2012, Ellis-Bextor worked with British singer and producer Ed Harcourt on a ""more concept driven record"", and possibly having as few as eight tracks. Her performance at a London charity gala in November 2012 including a new song, ""Young Blood""; a demo of the song was released in March 2013 as a complimentary digital download from her website, as a thank you gift to her fans. Also in 2013, she performed outdoors at Old Republic Square in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Ellis-Bextor confirmed completion of the album in May and revealed its title, Wanderlust, and cover art in October.

""Young Blood"" was released as the lead single from Wanderlust in November 2013, peaking at number three on the UK Indie Chart and at number 34 on the UK Singles Chart.

The track was remixed by Paul Oakenfold, Roddy Reynaert and Pearson and Hirst, among others.In January 2015, Ellis-Bextor said that she had begun working on her sixth studio album, once again with Ed Harcourt. In January 2016, Ellis-Bextor posted an image on Instagram captioned ""Last song written. Next stop - rehearsals! #album6 #whatthehellshouldicallit."" She also posted a YouTube video of the making of the album. According to Ellis-Bextor, the album, titled Familia, was inspired by a recent visit to North America, particularly Mexico. Familia is the Spanish word for ""family"" (a tattoo Ellis-Bextor wears in her arm since her first child's birth) and Ellis-Bextor described the album's sound as closer to that of her earlier albums. She explained that she ""wanted something with a Spanish or Italian feel"" and that it continued some stories from Wanderlust. Familia was released in September 2016 and reached number 12 on the UK Albums Chart. It spawned four singles, but none of them made it into any major chart. After taking time off for the birth of her child in late 2015, she resumed touring in 2017, mostly at small venues in the UK.

In November 2017, she announced via Facebook a selection of her greatest hits reworked with an orchestra. In February 2018, she announced the album's title, The Song Diaries, and pointed out that it would consist of re-recorded tracks spanning her career from theaudience to Familia's ""Wild Forever"", plus a new track.

On 3 October (11 October, in US), 2011, her debut album Emika came out (all four singles included), described as the mix of ""bewitching, atmospheric melodies and glitchy electronic beats"" and getting good reviews. Emika's music has been described as being influenced by various genres like early dubstep, electronica and classical, critics compared her to PJ Harvey, The xx, Zola Jesus and Beth Gibbons.

On 18 October 2011 Emika embarked upon her first American tour, supporting Amon Tobin on his ISAM tour and she has continued to play live shows all over the world throughout 2012 in countries such as Austria, Czech Republic, France, Ireland, Norway, Switzerland, Russia and Turkey. She performed a live set in Berlin for music streaming website Boiler Room in 2012.

Despite her self-described ""nerdy,"" studio-based background, Emika notes a major shift in her recent output evolving from the isolated nature of her self-titled debut LP to a more interactive and freewheeling piece of work in 2013's Dva.

Paloma Faith,"Paloma Faith Blomfield was born in the Hackney area of London on 21 July 1981, the daughter of an English mother and Spanish father. Both of her parents were raised in Norfolk. Her parents separated when she was two years old and divorced two years later. She was raised by her mother in Stoke Newington, although she maintains a close relationship with her paternal grandmother. As a child, she took ballet classes in Dalston. After completing her A-levels at City and Islington College, she went on to study for a degree in contemporary dance at the Northern School of Contemporary Dance in Leeds, while working as a hip-hop dancer at the nightclub LoveDough. She then studied for an MA in theatre directing at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and took various part-time jobs as a sales assistant at Agent Provocateur, a singer in a burlesque cabaret, a bartender, a life model, and a magician's assistant.","Faith's first foray into music began when she mimicked famous soul and jazz singers including Etta James and Billie Holiday, whom she admires and cites as influences for her own work. She met her managers Jamie Binns and Christian Wåhlberg of Lateral Management in 2007. Binns had been tipped off by the producer Peanut, a client who had recently worked with Faith in his studio and been impressed. He met up with Faith shortly afterwards and was ""completely blown away"", later saying, ""I wasn't sure what this girl was going to do – she was an actress and a singer – but there was just something about her in that artistic realness that when I came out of the meeting I called Christian and said, 'We have to do something with this girl!'""

During her time at college, Faith worked in a pub where the manager asked her to front his band, which they later called Paloma and the Penetrators. During a performance with the band at a cabaret show, she was scouted by an A&R man from Epic Records, who invited her to sing for the manager of the label. 20 minutes into the audition, she asked the manager to turn his phone off; when he refused, she walked out.

Findlay (musician),"Findlay started playing the guitar when she was around 15 and after about a year began writing songs. She took up music for the simple fact that she wasn't into anything else growing up. She joked that ""(she) can't really do anything else.""","On 24 November 2013, Findlay released her second EP Greasy Love.

Abi Finley,N/A,"Shortly after How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria? finished in late 2006, Finley was cast by the Oscar-winning lyricist Sir Tim Rice in his revival of Blondel. On casting Finley, Rice said in an interview with Hello Magazine, ""Fiona has to be funny, feisty, and sexy. Plenty of candidates have two of the necessary attributes.  Only Abi had all three... when you see Abi on stage, you actually want to look at her.  I'd be amazed if Abi is not a big star pretty soon."" Geoff Ambler, reviewing Blondel, said of Finley's performance, ""Abi Finley, the beautiful and talented one from A Problem like Maria, proves that she can act with confident poise among the best, as well as sing, in what is her professional stage debut. This tight, witty show with its tremendous cast is one of the best to open in London this year.""

In early 2007, straight from Blondel, Finley landed the part of Serena in Fame on a UK national tour. She had to audition for the part, then practice, while also learning the part of Fiona in Blondel. Ian Pearce, who reviewed the show for the BBC, said, ""The first thing that strikes you is the quality of the live band and the sheer exuberance of the dancing... a strong performance comes from Abi Finley as the somewhat dowdy Serena.""

On Christmas Eve 2007, Finley was seen performing with Lee Mead and Connie Fisher and some of the other How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria? and Any Dream Will Do finalists in a BBC special ""festive"" reunion show called When Joseph met Maria!, celebrating both the hit Andrew Lloyd Webber BBC shows, recorded earlier on 2 December 2007. How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria? won an international Emmy Award in 2007 for best non-scripted entertainment.

From 6 May 2008, Finley starred as Miranda, the disembodied German head in Betwixt! The Musical. The show opened on 6 May 2008, and ran until 22 June at The King's Head Theatre, Islington.

Finley starred as Jane in Gareth Peter's Bluebird the Musical, a musical set in the Second World War, alongside I'd Do Anything finalist Sarah Lark and Ramin Karimloo. During December 2011 and January 2012, Finley will be appearing in the German production of the tribal-rock musical Hair, in which she plays ensemble and covers the lead role of Sheila.",N/A,N/A,British actress,10/8/1982,N/A,N/A,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abi_Finley

Florrie,"Florrie was born Florence Arnold on 28 December 1988 in Bristol, where she attended Colston's Girls' School. She became interested in playing the drums when she was in Greece on a family holiday at age six. As a teenager she started her own band called Fi Fi Saloon, which performed Avril Lavigne covers and original songs she described as ""really trash, punky girl rock-pop"". She moved to London when she was 17 years old and gigged with several bands including Selfservice, who signed a development deal with songwriter Guy Chambers. Florrie performed with Selfservice at night and worked part-time as a nanny during the day.

A meeting with the manager of Australian singer Gabriella Cilmi led Florrie to a successful audition as the drummer in the houseband of Xenomania, the successful Kent-based production team. Her first job was playing on Girls Aloud's 2008 single ""The Promise"", although she also assisted with administration work. She provided drums and drum programming on Xenomania-produced tracks by Alesha Dixon, Rebecca Ferguson, Kylie Minogue, Pet Shop Boys, and The Saturdays. She also co-wrote the 2010 single ""One Touch"" for the short-lived female duo Mini Viva, ""Something New"" (2012) for Girls Aloud, and ""What Are You Waiting For?"" (2014) for The Saturdays. Xenomania producer Brian Higgins encouraged Florrie to sing one of the songs she had written, which prompted her to pursue her own music career.Florrie's debut release, a Fred Falke remix of ""Call 911"", reportedly had over 1,000 downloads around the world within a few days of its February 2010 release. In mid-2010, Florrie was announced as the face of the then-new Nina Ricci fragrance Nina L'Elixir. She starred in the TV advert for the campaign performing a cover of Blondie's ""Sunday Girl"", and also featured in print advertisements shot by Ruven Afanador. In July 2010, Florrie featured on The Guardians ""New Band of the Day"" column. Besides these two tracks, three more were released as remix-only versions: ""Panic Attack"" (April 2010), ""Fascinate Me"" and ""Come Back to Mine"" (May 2010).

Florrie released her debut EP, Introduction, in November 2010 through the iTunes Store. The EP was made available for free download on her official website, as well as on 12"" vinyl pressings limited to 500 copies. Music blogs Popjustice, ArjanWrites.com, electronic rumors, Dödselectro and Sundtrak praised the quality of the music, while noting the free availability of the tracks and expressing interest for future material. Others identified how the awareness of Florrie's music has been assisted by online social networks and a grassroots strategy. Florrie told Ponystep magazine:

""I think it's really important to have that contact with fans and for them to be able to buy into your world or you as a person without any pressure from a corporation [...] It's a better way of doing it because people can feel like they discovered you as opposed to a major label. I want my fans to feel like they have some sort of ownership.""

Florrie's second EP, Experiments, was released in June 2011 to a five-star review from About.com. The lead single, ""Begging Me"" was released in April 2011. The music video for the second single, ""I Took a Little Something"", was a collaboration with fashion house Dolce & Gabbana. A third EP, Late, was released in May 2012 on iTunes, accompanied by the single ""Shot You Down"". MuuMuse wrote of the EP, ""Every inch of the record is one carefully crafted hook after another; each pulsating beat more danceable and jaw-dropping than the next"".Florrie announced on her website in mid-2012 that she would sign to a major record label, thus making Late her final release as an independent artist; this label was later reported as being Sony Music. In February 2013, Florrie was announced as the face of denim label Vigoss for its spring 2013 campaign. Florrie appears in the commercial for Sony's XBA-C10 in-ear headphones, which debuted in April 2013 and features the track ""Live a Little"".

Florrie released her fourth EP, Sirens, in April 2014, with music videos accompanying three of the tracks. A single, ""Little White Lies"", followed in August 2014. The music video for Florrie's 2015 single ""Too Young to Remember"" was premiered online via fashion retailer H&M, who selected the singer to front their worldwide H&M Loves Music campaign. Her debut album was originally announced for 2015 and was planned for release in late 2016, following a series of festival appearances and other live dates. Florrie has been recording with songwriters and producers including Joel Little, Tim Anderson, MoZella, Jesse Shatkin, and Twin, the latter of whom produced and co-wrote Florrie's single ""Real Love"" (released in early 2016). Unfortunately, due to Sony and Florrie's creative visions clashing, the two had parted ways as it was said that Sony enticed her to drift away from making music from Xenomania and work with others. This also meant that the album was scrapped.

In 2019, she made a musical comeback with the single ""Borderline"", where she was currently signed to Xenomania's newly-established self-titled label. She was also announced as a member of the group Capulets, with whom she plays and writes for. She also released another single later on in the year, entitled ""Unstable"", where she could be gearing up to release a new project.

In May 2020, she released new the song ""Hell or High Water"", which in the latter weeks of the month, helped to promote Xenomania's newest signees Clara McHugh and Paige Cavell who also released new music.

On 6 April 2020, Florrie released the song ""Butterflies.""",N/A,"

Samantha Fox,"Fox was born on 15 April 1966 in Mile End, East London, the elder daughter of actress Carole Ann Wilken and John Patrick Fox. Her sister is Vanessa and she has two half-siblings from her father's second marriage, Frederica and Frankie. Fox comes from a family of market traders.

Fox took an interest in the theatre from an early age; she first appeared on a theatre stage when she was three years old. She formed her first pop band with Richard Smart, Edward Gallagher and Bob Day when she was fourteen. She attended St Thomas More Catholic School, Wood Green; and was enrolled in the Anna Scher Theatre School from the age of fifteen. The next year she signed her first record deal, with Lamborghini Records.","In 1983, when Fox was 16, she released her first single. Credited as S.F.X. and released on the Lamborghini Records label, ""Rockin' With My Radio""/""My Old Man"" was produced by Ian Gillan Band and Spencer Davis Group member Ray Fenwick, who also wrote the b-side. The collaboration with Fenwick continued into 1984 and her second single, ""Aim to Win""/""17 and Holding"", credited under her full name, where Fenwick again produced and wrote the song on the b-side.

Also, in 1983, her mother submitted several photographs that she had taken of her daughter in lingerie to The Sunday People newspaper's Girl of the Year amateur modelling contest. She came in second place out of 20,000 entrants and the photographs drew her to the attention of the newspaper The Sun, which invited her to pose for Page 3.

Her parents gave their consent for her to pose topless, and her first Page 3 photograph appeared in the Sun on 22 February 1983. She signed a four-year Page 3 modelling contract with the Sun, and won its ""Page 3 Girl of the Year"" award for three consecutive years: 1984 to 1986. She is recognised today as the most popular pin-up girl of her era, as well as one of the most-photographed British women of the 1980s.

In 1986, Fox retired from Page 3 modelling, at the age of 20, and transitioned into a career in pop music. In 1995, aged 29, she made a one-off appearance in The Sun to promote Page 3's 25th anniversary.

Foxes (singer),N/A,"Allen devised a stage name to differentiate herself from British pop singer Lily Allen. She considered the alias Foxes after a suggestion from a friend, the first song she had written being titled ""Like Foxes Do""; her mother then told her that she had a dream the previous night ""about these foxes running up our street and they were howling and making these beautiful noises"", which she said reminded her of her daughter's music. Allen chose Foxes based on this connection. She began performing gigs as Foxes in London in 2011.

Foxes released her debut single, ""Youth"", in January 2012 on Neon Gold Records, and the following month was signed to Sign of the Times, a Simon Fuller-owned UK imprint of Sony Music Entertainment. ""Youth"" and its B-side, ""Home"", were featured in the American television series Gossip Girl and an EP, Warrior (produced by Samuel Dixon, also known as Sam Kennedy), followed in July 2012, which Foxes promoted with a US tour. Paste magazine described Warrior as ""a beautifully ethereal EP that warrants all sorts of comparisons, but equally manages to stand on its own two feet"", while PopMatters wrote that it was ""a powerful, well-rounded set"" and Consequence of Sound introduced the singer as ""[i]f Florence Welch and Katy Perry had a beautiful, brunette love child"". Later in 2012, Foxes toured with Marina and the Diamonds on her Lonely Hearts Club Tour and released a second single, ""Echo"".

""Youth"" caught the attention of dance producer Zedd, who invited Foxes to feature on his song ""Clarity"". ""Clarity"" was released as a single in late 2012 and became a major hit during 2013, reaching number eight on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Hot Dance Club Songs. The song was certified double platinum in Australia, platinum in the United States, and gold in the United Kingdom, where it reached number 27 on the UK Singles Chart. At the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, Zedd and Foxes won the award for Best Dance Recording. Also in 2013, Foxes featured on Fall Out Boy's song ""Just One Yesterday"" from their album Save Rock and Roll, on the Rudimental single ""Right Here"" (a top 20 hit in the United Kingdom) and on the Sub Focus track ""Until the End"", from his album Torus.

Foxes's ""teaser"" single ""Beauty Queen"" was released in May 2013, followed by a US re-release of ""Youth"" in August 2013 after Foxes signed to RCA Records in the country. In the United Kingdom, ""Youth"" reached number 12 on the singles chart in October 2013, concurrent to the song's use in a high profile advertising campaign for retailer Debenhams. During late 2013, Foxes embarked on a headline tour of the United Kingdom. A newly recorded version of ""Let Go for Tonight"", a track previously featured on the Warrior EP, was released as a single in February 2014, charting in the United Kingdom at number seven&mdash;Foxes's first top ten hit.

On 17 April 2014, Foxes appeared on BBC Radio 1's Innuendo Bingo. Foxes's debut album, Glorious, was released in May 2014 following the single ""Holding onto Heaven"" (number 14), and debuted at number five on the UK Albums Chart. A fourth single, ""Glorious"", followed in August 2014 and was used in an ITV advertising campaign promoting the network's autumn season of programmes. During September and October 2014, Foxes served as the opening act for R&B musician Pharrell's Dear Girl Tour, playing to arenas across Europe. Pharrell personally offered a support slot to Foxes after hearing her cover of his hit single ""Happy"" for Radio 1's Live Lounge; Foxes later accused producers of the televised singing competition The X Factor for copying her arrangement of ""Happy"" for a performance of the song by contestant Lauren Platt, as both versions interpolated the Massive Attack song ""Teardrop"". Also in October, Foxes featured in the eighth series of the BBC science fiction series Doctor Who, performing Queen's ""Don't Stop Me Now"" in the episode ""Mummy on the Orient Express"". In December, Foxes toured the United Kingdom once again as a headliner.Foxes stated in a late 2014 interview that she had commenced work on her second album. She also collaborated with veteran dance producer Giorgio Moroder on his 2015 solo album, Déjà Vu, featuring on the track ""Wildstar"". In subsequent interviews, Foxes said that the album is titled All I Need and that she hoped to release it in late 2015. Recording sessions took place in America, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

All I Need was released on 5 February 2016. The album's first single, ""Body Talk"", was released in July 2015 and reached number 25 on the UK Singles Chart. Foxes debuted the track during a one-day tour of seven UK cities that earned her an entry to the Guinness World Records for the title of ""most live concerts in 12 hours in multiple cities"". The album's track listing and the video for the song ""Feet Don't Fail Me Now"" were also released in July. The second single, ""Better Love"", was released in September 2015. Following this Foxes embarked on a headline UK tour, supported by Izzy Bizu. The third single ""Amazing"" was released on 4 December 2015. ""Amazing"" was used by ITV in an advertsiment to promote their Christmas programming. Foxes featured on Kygo's track ""Oasis"" from his album Cloud Nine, which was released on 13 May 2016. ""Cruel"" was released as the fourth single from All I Need on 19 April 2016 with an accompanying music video released on the same date. In the same month, Foxes was announced to be one of the supporting acts of British alternative rock band Coldplay in the European and North American legs of their A Head Full of Dreams Tour, alongside Alessia Cara.

In March 2017, ITV used Foxes's song ""Scar"" to promote Grantchester's third series. She performed at the Indonesian Television Awards on 20 September 2017, performing songs including ""Better Love"", ""Let Go For Tonight"" and ""Clarity"". In February 2018, Foxes teased of new music, stating ""Thank you for your patience with this next record... I will be releasing new music this year and I can't wait to share it with you"".On 15 May 2020, Foxes teased of new music on her social media platforms by sharing three videos, one each day, which consisted of her asking a question. These videos were accompanied by a phone number one could ring to answer the question. The lead single from her upcoming project, ""Love Not Loving You"", was released on 20 May 2020, marking her first song release in four years. On the same day, it was revealed that Foxes has signed a new record deal with PIAS Recordings, thus making the single her first release under the label.

This was followed by the third and fourth singles, ""Friends in the Corner"" and ""Hollywood"" which were released on 2 September 2020 and 4 December 2020 respectively. The latter was described as a ""cathartic experience"" by Clash magazine.

On 17 March 2021, Foxes released the single ""Kathleen"" and announced the release of her second EP Friends in the Corner, which would include all previously released singles and an additional two new songs. The EP is expected for a 1 April 2021 release.

Livvi Franc,"Franc was born in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England to an English mother and a Bajan father. Franc's stage name was inspired by her late maternal grandfather, Frank Wilson, she explained to Flavour Magazine that he had ""noticed me playing the piano and predicted I was going to be a musician. Sadly he’s no longer here. So, in honour of him, I called myself Livvi Franc; Livvi because it’s my nickname, and Franc because it’s a funkier version of Frank."" When Franc was five, the family moved to Barbados, because her parents decided that their daughters, Franc and her elder sister, should experience their Barbadian heritage. They would return to England during the summer holidays. Franc wrote her first song at age eleven and learned the guitar at fifteen and sang in school talent shows and pageants growing up.","Franc's first manager discovered her when a friend of Franc's who babysitted for her gave her one of Franc's cassette tape demos. Franc then went on to record proper demos in studio in Barbados and Miami, where she met her next manager. Soon after, she was in New York meeting label heads and auditioning. She finally signed with Jive Records, after months of negotiations, after singing an Etta James song for them. Prior to signing with Jive, Franc had gone through three years of artist development and attended workshops on it. She had attended Queens College in Barbados. Jordin Sparks recorded a song written by Livvi Franc, ""Walking On Snow"", Franc has also written for Cheryl Cole, Kelly Clarkson, Marié Digby, Michael Jackson, Britney Spears, Rihanna and Cher Lloyd.

Franc's debut single, ""Now I'm That Bitch"" was released in the summer of 2009. The song topped the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart and became a top 40 hit in New Zealand and the UK. Another song, ""This Is a Raid"" appeared on the reboot of Melrose Place. Franc released her second single named ""Automatik"". Produced by RedOne, the single peaked at #6 on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart. During the end of 2010, the album was eventually shelved by Jive and so Livvi left Jive Records, however quickly signed to Beluga Heights/Warner Bros., where she is currently finishing her debut album. In a UStream session, Franc said she is delaying working on her own album and instead is focusing on writing for other acts.","Underground Sunshine - Album Sampler—*Released: 2009 *Label: RCA, Sony *Formats: Promo CD,Livvi Franc—*Released: 2010 *Label: RCA, Sony *Formats: Promo CD,

Steph Fraser,N/A,"Fraser has toured extensively in the UK and Canada including 2007 performances at the BBC Radio 2 Blackpool Illuminations Switch On Event, where she played in front of 19,000 people and shared the bill with McFly, Natalie Imbruglia and Natasha Bedingfield. This was after she had won the Blackpool Evening Gazette young talent contest.

In March 2008, she was invited to perform at Canadian Music Week at the Fairmont Royal York Hotel in Toronto. Her label provided her with the opportunity to record at Catherine North Studios in Hamilton, Ontario while she was in Canada. The recordings, which were overseen by Canadian producer Dan Achen resulted in her first EP ""Purple Sun"" being released in May the same year. The single was well received with R2 (Rock'n'Reel) magazine saying she had real potential.

The single was also featured on the BBC Radio Merseyside show ""On The Beat"" hosted by Spencer Leigh. One of the panel members was Sam Leach the former Beatles mentor and promoter who said that Fraser was heading for the big time and that he could listen to her all night. Fraser was involved in a transatlantic link up with BBC Radio Lancashire who interviewed her in Canada, and subsequently featured her in numerous programs, including sessions and intimate theatre performances at their studios in Blackburn, Lancashire. In August 2008, she embarked on her first Canadian tour where she played 10 shows including a support slot to Canadian folk singer Heather Dale. She also recorded another batch of songs at Catherine North Studios during the trip.

Fraser parted company with collaborator Stephen Ladley in 2008, and began working with young musician Phil Simpson and performed for the second time at both Canadian Music Week 2009 and Liverpool Sound City 2009 as a showcasing artist.

Justine Frischmann,"Frischmann previously dated her Suede bandmate Brett Anderson. She then dated Blur lead singer Damon Albarn from 1991 until the couple broke up in 1998, which served as inspiration for the band's 1999 singles ""No Distance Left to Run"" and ""Tender"". In the spring of 2000, Frischmann took up competitive fencing.

Frischmann is now married to a climate scientist, Professor Ian Faloona, and lives and works in the USA.","Frischmann has said, ""The themes and ideas I am working with are in direct relation to an ongoing personal narrative; the big questions are reflected in the choices I make in my art...[including] my ever-evolving relationship with my spiritual faith. I think my approach and aesthetics reveal internal struggles and speak to my family origins and history.""

In 2005, Frischmann moved to Boulder, Colorado, where she studied visual arts at Naropa University, a small, Buddhist-inspired liberal arts college.

In 2012 her work was shortlisted for the UK's Marmite Prize for painting, and she has been included in The Amsterdam List of 1000 Living Painters.Frischmann began writing and studying music at the age of eleven.

She was a founding member of the band Suede with Brett Anderson, whom she met at UCL in 1988. She left the band in October 1991. In the 2018 documentary ""The Insatiable Ones"", Anderson cites her as huge influence on the band's first album.

Frischmann later founded and fronted her own band, Elastica. Their first album, Elastica, released in 1995, became the fastest selling debut album in UK history. They were signed to Deceptive Records in the UK, and later with Geffen Records in Europe and the US. In 1994, Elastica was voted Best New Band by NME readers at the Brat awards. In 1995, Elastica was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize for their album Elastica. The album went on to sell over a million copies worldwide. In 2001 the band announced an amicable breakup, citing, in part, burnout from a grueling touring schedule.

Frischmann spent the next few years developing artist M.I.A., whom she discovered. M.I.A. was Frischmann's friend and flatmate. Frischmann co-wrote and produced M.I.A.'s demos for her first album, Arular, most notably its 2003 single ""Galang"".

Frischmann left London in 2005 to enroll in a masters program at Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado, and ""become a nobody"". In a 2016 interview regarding her art career, Frischmann stated, ""I don't really have any desire to make music, to be honest.""

In 2017, Rough Trade Records released a remastered version of Elastica's first eponymously titled album. That year, there were rumours that Elastica had been asked to perform at M.I.A.'s Meltdown at the Southbank. In 2019, Rough Trade released a limited edition Elastica BBC sessions album on UK Record Store Day.In 2003, Frischmann co-presented a series called Dreamspaces for the BBC Television about modern architecture.

Jenny Frost,"Frost was born in Wallasey, Merseyside and grew up in Manchester. She loved music from an early age. Her earliest concert experience was when her father took her to a Level 42 concert at the age of nine. Sport and dancing were Frost's favourite activities, however, modelling was her dream. After attending St Monica's High School she started to work for the BBC Television doing the Holiday programme and travelling around the world.","Frost started her musical career in 1998 in the group Precious, who were the UK entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 1999, with the song ""Say It Again"". The song was a top 10 hit in the UK Singles Chart and came twelfth in the contest itself. Subsequent releases by Precious enjoyed only modest success, and their debut album failed to chart at all, ultimately leading the group to go their separate ways by the end of 2000. Frost moved on by replacing Kerry Katona in Atomic Kitten, a girl group founded by OMD frontman Andy McCluskey, in 2001. After the release of their third studio album, Atomic Kitten split in 2004 although reformed in 2005, 2006 and 2008. On 4 March 2012 it was confirmed that Atomic Kitten would reform but was later confirmed that Frost would not be returning to the group and would be replaced by Kerry Katona. Hamilton has since confirmed that Frost would be welcomed back if she wanted to rejoin the group in the future. On 6 July 2021, it was announced that Frost had rejoined Atomic Kitten with the release of 'Southgate You're the One (Football's Coming Home Again)', a remake of 'Whole Again' for the 2020 Euros.After the split of Atomic Kitten, Frost embarked on a solo career and released her first single ""Crash Landing"" on 10 October 2005, which peaked at number 47 and thus failed to reach the Top 40. Frost originally recorded the song for the band Route 1, but decided to remake it and shoot a music video for the song which featured her in a spaceship in a pink/purple setting. Jenny has recorded many other songs in hope of releasing a solo album, ""Mirrors"" and ""Bad Girl"", being amongst them. In February 2009, Jenny Frost stated that she did not want to continue her work in music as a solo artist and she wanted to stay in the music industry only as a member of Atomic Kitten.","OTitle—Year—UK—SCO—Album,""Crash Landing"" (with Route 1)—2005—47—38—Non-album single,""—"" denotes releases that did not chart or were not released in that territory.,""On Me Head Son""—2001—Sporting Les and Liz McClarnon—Mike Bassett: England Manager,""Here Kitty Kitty""—2005—Hell Razah—Black Presidents Mixtape Vol. 1,",N/A,British singer (b. 1978),22/1/1978,"1998–2012, 2021-present",Pop,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Frost

Arzutraa,"Arzutraa grew up in Greenwich a suburb of London. Her parents are from Africa and grandparents from India who left India upon the partition of India in 1947. From an early age, she studied instruments, dancing, poetry-writing and singing. In an interview, Arzutraa said that she was discouraged from pursuing music by her parents, who preferred her to concentrate on academics. Her poetry-writing turned into song-writing, and though she claimed never to have set out to be a singer that music had always been important to her. After being praised for her voice, she decided to pursue a music career. Growing up with separated parents, Arzutraa was raised by her mother & older brother. Although she did no live with her father, her Bollywood inspiration came from watching movies with him at a young age.","Arzutraa decded early on that she wanted to sing in Hindi. However she did not know any Indian languages and was advised that she could never sing in the dialect.

Helen George,"George was born in Harborne, Birmingham, to political science professor Neil Thomas and social worker Margareth Thomas. She has a sister, Elizabeth, a veterinarian. Raised in Winchester, Hampshire, she attended Henry Beaufort School in 1995 and studied ballet as a child, eventually becoming a junior associate at Birmingham Royal Ballet, and was active in sports, competing in the long jump. As a child she dreamed of being the first female manager of Aston Villa football club.

George decided that she wanted to work in musical theatre at the age of 15, when she saw a production of Les Misérables. She is a graduate of the Royal Academy of Music, having formerly attended the Henry Beaufort School, Winchester between 1995 and 2000. George also attended Birmingham School of Acting.","George attended the Royal Academy of Music, London, studying musical theatre. She gained her first role some two weeks after graduation in the play The Woman in White. She was a backing singer for Elton John during a tour. She sang at venues including both Wembley Arena and the Royal Albert Hall.

George was cast in the role of Trixie on the BBC One series Call the Midwife, based on the book by Jennifer Worth. She was daunted by the prospect of working with the likes of Pam Ferris and Jenny Agutter. As part of the role she was trained in the medical techniques of the 1950s, including how to deliver a baby. In 2012, she underwent a press tour in the United States to promote the series there. She also starred in the music video for singer Birdy's cover of ""1901"".

In August 2015, George was announced as one of the celebrities who would compete in the thirteenth series of Strictly Come Dancing. She was partnered with professional dancer Aljaž Škorjanec.

GFOTY,"GFOTY is the daughter of art dealer Jeff Salmon. She grew up in London, England and ran a blog. Her earliest songs include ""Take a Picture"", which includes rap group Serious Thugs, and ""Friday Night"", which is a darkly-comical take on pop clichés about partying teenagers. A remix of the latter has since been incorporated into producer Sophie's sets.

Her debut single, ""Bobby"", was released in 2013 via the PC Music record label and collective. It describes feelings of futility after a breakup. GFOTY uses a spoken word delivery over a tense, synthesised wall of sound. She released Secret Mix in March 2014. It includes cover versions of songs by Celine Dion, Toni Braxton, and Carly Simon. Tiny Mix Tapes named Secret Mix the third best music release of 2014. She also appeared on PC Music's mix for DIS Magazine DISown. Focusing on the relationship between art and commerce, her contribution includes conspicuous product placement for Red Bull. One of the songs from her mix became her second single ""Don't Wanna / Let's Do It"". It creates an uneasy mood by taking two conflicting phrases and frantically sampling them.

GFOTY contributed vocals to ""Hard"", the B-side to Sophie's ""Lemonade"" single. In September 2014, producer Ryan Hemsworth released the compilation EP shh#ffb6c1 on his pseudo-label Secret Songs, which included a GFOTY-featured track named ""My Song"". Shortly after, she collaborated with PC Music artist Maxo on ""Not That Bad"".

For Halloween in 2014, GFOTY appeared alongside fellow label artists including A. G. Cook and Danny L Harle for a single, special live Halloween webcast named Dead or Alive. All of the PC Music artists appeared in the webcast, portraying spooky alter egos of themselves. GFOTY's persona was ""Ghoulfriend of the Year"". The show was broadcast in the UK, USA, Denmark and Japan.

In 2015 GFOTY released a mix titled Cake Mix. It is composed of bright, saccharine songs interspersed with buzzing, glitchy breakdowns. The mix includes an adaptation of Peter Andre's 1996 single ""Mysterious Girl"" featuring Bubbler Ranx and a cover of Blink-182's 2000 single ""All the Small Things"". In March 2015, a mix titled Dog Food Mix 1 with PC Music artist Spinee was released, as a reworking of GFOTY's earlier songs. A second mix, Dog Food Mix 2, was released in May 2015.

March 2015 saw GFOTY head to the USA to play the PC Music showcase at the Empire Garage in Austin, Texas as part of SXSW. Her performance was well received, with Exclaim! writing that it was a ""fascinating set"" and Noisey saying ""Here's what I did when I saw GFOTY, which was probably the best thing I've seen all week: I fucking lost my mind. I loved it. I was ecstatic."" On 8 May 2015, GFOTY performed as part of a PC Music show at BRIC House in Brooklyn, New York as part of the Red Bull Music Academy Festival. The show was billed as the premiere of Pop Cube, ""a multimedia reality network"".

On 25 October 2016, GFOTY released a glitch pop-influenced pop rock EP titled Call Him A Doctor, which is presumed to be a continuation of her previous EP, VIPOTY.

On 9 November 2017, the single ""Tongue"" was released with an accompanying joint music video for ""Tongue"" and the VIPOTY track ""Poison"". ""Tongue"" is a single from her ""greatest hits"" compilation called GFOTYBUCKS - which contains 19 tracks from VIPOTY, Call Him A Doctor, past mixes, and various singles - was released on 17 November 2017. On the same date, a ""32 page magazine created by GFOTY with exclusive GFOTYBUCKS recipes, lyrics and artwork by various GFOTY approved artists"" is available to buy as a bundle with the GFOTYBUCKS CD.

On 14 December 2018, GFOTY confirmed that she had left the PC Music label to become an indie artist. She released her single ""Boy Next Door"" under her own label ""GIRLFRIEND RECORDS.""

Beth Gibbons,"Gibbons was born in Exeter, Devon, England and raised on a farm with three sisters. Her parents divorced when she was young. At 22, she moved to Bath, then Bristol to pursue her singing career, where she met Geoff Barrow, her future collaborator in Portishead.","With Adrian Utley, Gibbons and Barrow released the first Portishead album Dummy in 1994 and have produced two other studio albums, a live album, and various singles in the years since.

She has also collaborated on a separate project with former Talk Talk bassist Paul Webb (Rustin Man). Before she joined Geoff Barrow in Portishead, she had auditioned for the singer's slot in .O.rang, the group formed by Webb after Talk Talk's late-Eighties departure from EMI, but Portishead's sudden success pre-empted matters. In October 2002, they released the album Out of Season in the United Kingdom under the name Beth Gibbons and Rustin Man. The album peaked at number 28 in the UK Albums Chart. It was released in the United States a year later: while touring in North America, Variety favourably described her performance with Rustin as ""Billie Holiday fronting Siouxsie and the Banshees"".

Gibbons was also a judge for the 10th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers.

In June 2013, Gibbons announced plans for a new solo album with Domino Records. She contributed vocals to a cover of the song ""Black Sabbath"" with the British metal band Gonga, entitled ""Black Sabbeth"", released on 24 April 2014.

In 2018, Gibbons contributed vocal performances, along with Elizabeth Fraser of the Cocteau Twins, to the Spill Festival held in Ipswich in an audio installation entitled 'Clarion Calls', which uses the voices of 100 women to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.

Her 2019 album, recorded with the Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki, Henryk Górecki: Symphony No. 3 (Symphony of Sorrowful Songs), was released in March. The recording was made during a 2014 concert. Gibbons had to study the Polish language especially for this performance.","

Gillian Gilbert,"Gilbert's family moved from her birthplace, Manchester, to the nearby market town of Macclesfield when she was young. She disliked living in Cheshire as a teenager and had wanted to live in Manchester.

In the late 1970s, seeing Siouxsie and the Banshees play live on UK television was a life changing experience for her. ""Me dad always says to us, 'You changed as soon as you saw Siouxsie and the Banshees on television'... And I really liked Gaye Advert out of the Adverts, who played bass, and I thought, 'Oh, there's nobody playin' guitar' - you know, women in bands."" Her uncle taught her how to play guitar.

She then was in a punk band with three girls, The Inadequates, who rehearsed at premises next to Joy Division. In a 1987 interview with Option, Gilbert reflected on the first time she became familiar with Joy Division: ""We didn't have a car and us three needed a lift home. So we asked them, and they said, 'Alright, but you have to buy one of our singles.' So we did and got it home and played it on this horrible record player. We'd known Stephen before. We thought, 'My God, this sounds horrible.'"" She would later begin dating Stephen Morris.

After Ian Curtis's death in May 1980, the three remaining members of Joy Division renamed the band New Order. Wishing to complete their line-up with someone they knew well and whose musical skill and style was compatible with their own, New Order invited Gilbert to join the band during the early part of October 1980, as keyboardist and guitarist. She had already played with Joy Division a number of times, filling in for both Curtis and Sumner playing guitar. New Order's manager Rob Gretton suggested she should join. Gilbert's first live performance with them occurred at The Squat in Manchester on 25 October 1980.

Her voice can be heard on several New Order tracks: the 1981 single ""Procession""; the 1983 single ""Confusion""; ""Avalanche"" from the album Republic on which she sang a single word, ""faith""; and ""Doubts Even Here"" from their first album, Movement, on which she provided a spoken-word background vocal.

Given that fellow band members Sumner and Hook had already produced music outside New Order, Gilbert and Morris formed their own band, The Other Two. They released their first single ""Tasty Fish"" in 1991, and recorded two albums: The Other Two & You, released in 1993, and Super Highways in 1999.

Gilbert and Morris were engaged in 1993, and married the following year. The couple live in Rainow, outside Macclesfield, and have two daughters. Gilbert stopped touring with New Order in 1998 so that she could care for their children, one of whom suffers from neuromyelitis optica. Her husband had briefly offered to care for the children, but Gilbert reasoned that it would be easier for the band to replace her than her husband. She participated in the recording of 2001's Get Ready, after which she was replaced by Phil Cunningham in New Order's line-up.

In 2007, Gilbert and Morris remixed two tracks for the Nine Inch Nails remixes album Year Zero Remixed. That year she was diagnosed with breast cancer, from which she recovered.

She rejoined New Order in 2011, after a 10-year absence from their albums. She performed alongside Cunningham who remained a member, expanding the group to a quintet. She is quoted as being glad that she did other things during that time. Since 2011, New Order have performed across the world. Their album Music Complete was released in September 2015.

Thea Gilmore,"Gilmore was born in Oxford to Irish parents and lived in the village of North Aston, Oxfordshire. She became interested in music as a result of her father's record collection, which included work by Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, and The Beatles. Later, she listened to Elvis Costello, Tom Waits, and The Replacements, among others. Having always written poetry and stories, she began seriously writing songs at the age of 15.","Gilmore began her career working in a recording studio, where she met Nigel Stonier. She released her first album as a teenager, entitled Burning Dorothy, in 1998 and over the course of the next four years, released increasingly well-received albums that earned her a reputation in the UK music press but no chart success.

In 2002 Gilmore shared lead vocals with Kellie While, beside musicians Maartin Allcock; John Kirkpatrick, Robbie McIntosh, Michael McGoldrick and Simon Swarbrick in the Reel and Soul Association. The project mixed American soul and British Folk music. The group's eponymously titled album gained considerable mainstream attention which resulted in numerous TV appearances and radio broadcasts including the BBC's Top of the Pops 2.

Gilmore finally made a breakthrough at 23 with the release of Avalanche in August 2003, which became her first album to break into the Official UK Album Chart, at No. 62, and spawned two minor hit singles, ""Juliet (Keep That in Mind)"" and ""Mainstream"", for which she garnered acclaim for producing a low-budget music video filmed in a local Virgin Megastore. The video received exposure on the BBC's flagship music show Top of the Pops 2.

In 2004, folk singer Joan Baez personally invited Gilmore to open for her during her tour leading up to the US presidential election. In 2005, Gilmore continued touring commitments, for the first time not releasing a new album (the covers collection Loft Music was widely released during 2004).

Gilmore finally returned to recording with the release of Harpo's Ghost in August 2006, after a two-and-a-half-year absence of new material. This was her first album on major label Sanctuary Records after many years of independent releases. The album was once again acclaimed in the music press and UK radio lent their support to the single ""Cheap Tricks"".

Subsequent to the release of Harpo's Ghost she parted company with her manager, left Sanctuary Records and released EP The Threads independently on her March 2007 UK tour with remaining copies sold on her website afterwards.

On 19 May 2008 Fruitcake Records (via Fullfill and distributed by Universal Records) released Liejacker, Gilmore's eighth album featuring contributions from Joan Baez, Dave McCabe, and Erin McKeown. It was preceded on 12 May by the single ""Old Soul"", a duet with McCabe. In June 2008, Gilmore signed to Rykodisc (Warner) for the United States. Liejacker was released in the US on 23 September 2008.

Thea's first live album, Recorded Delivery, was released on 25 May 2009, on Fullfill/Universal. The recordings are taken from UK shows during 2006 and 2008, with the first half of the album being acoustic, and the second half being electric, with a full band. In July 2009 she released a yearly subscription service / fan club, Angels in the Abattoir. Gilmore rounded out 2009 with the release of an album of Christmas- and winter-themed songs, Strange Communion, featuring eight originals penned by Gilmore and/or her then husband Nigel Stonier, as well as two cover versions – Yoko Ono's ""Listen, the Snow is Falling"" and Elvis Costello's ""The St. Stephen's Day Murders.""

Beginning in October 2010, Gilmore and her band were engaged in a UK tour and had good reviews.

In January 2011, Gilmore appeared at Glasgow Royal Concert Hall in a tribute concert celebrating the 70th Birthday of Bob Dylan. She performed versions of ""I Pity the Poor Immigrant"" and ""Masters of War."" Subsequently, Gilmore entered the studio with producer and husband Stonier and recorded the entire set of tracks found on Dylan's original release of John Wesley Harding. The album – also titled John Wesley Harding – was released 23 May 2011. 2011 saw the release of a collaboration with the late Sandy Denny entitled Don't Stop Singing and, in 2012, the CD single ""London"" was released from the album (and featured on the BBC coverage of the London 2012 Olympics montage of team GB medal winners). The single was also released as an exclusive Record Store Day 7″ single on 21 April.

In 2013 Gilmore released a new album of original material Regardless to critical acclaim and much exposure on BBC Radio 2. In May 2015 Ghosts And Graffiti was released, a retrospective with 4 new songs, and 6 newly recorded versions of songs from her back catalogue. Gilmore released The Counterweight in June 2017 through Cooking Vinyl Records. Small World Turning followed in 2019.

Jess Glynne,"Jess Glynne was born in Hampstead and raised in Muswell Hill, North London, in a Jewish family. Her father, Laurence Glynne, is an estate agent; and her mother, Alexandra (née Ingram), worked in A&R in the music industry. The family name was originally Goldstein, but her grandfather changed it to Glynne.

She applied for the television show The X Factor when she was 15 years old, but dropped out of the audition process following a disagreement with the producers.

She attended Rhodes Avenue Primary School, then attended Fortismere School, where she completed her A-levels in 2008, and took various jobs at a boutique, a fitness centre and a hairdresser's.

After a period spent travelling the world, Glynne worked for a music management company in her late teens and began networking with songwriters and producers, eventually honing her artistry for four years.","Glynne completed a year-long music course at an East London college, Access to Music London, where she met her future collaborators: songwriter Jin Jin and producer Bless Beats. She also studied in Westminster University. One of Glynne and Jin Jin's compositions caught the attention of Black Butter Records, who signed Glynne to a publishing deal and introduced her to music managers and lawyers. Black Butter co-president Joe Gossa said of Glynne, ""her voice just flipped me out, there was a fierceness to it. She can talk about everyday things in this way that's just epic"". She signed a contract with Atlantic Records in August 2013, consequently leaving her job at the time in brand management for a drinks company.In 2013, deep house producer Route 94 approached Glynne about rewriting and providing vocals for his song ""My Love"". It was later released as a single in February 2014 and reached number one on the UK Singles Chart. It was later certified Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry. British band Clean Bandit heard ""My Love"" and approached Glynne to feature on their song ""Rather Be"". Band member Jack Patterson spoke of ""a real subtlety of emotion in her voice"". The collaboration produced the single which also charted atop the UK charts, becoming the third fastest-selling single and most streamed song of 2014. The single attained number one and top five positions on charts across Europe and Oceania, and was a top ten hit on the US Billboard Hot 100. Both ""Rather Be"" and ""My Love"" received nominations at the BRIT Awards for Best British Single. For her work on ""Rather Be"", Glynne won the Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording and was nominated for Song of the Year at the inaugural BBC Music Awards.

In July 2014, Glynne's debut solo single, the Gorgon City-produced ""Right Here"" was released. It charted in several countries, including at number six in the UK. Glynne appeared at many British music festivals during mid 2014, including Bestival, Glastonbury, Lovebox, V Festival and Wireless. She toured around the UK from October 2014, beginning in Sheffield and finishing at the Electric Brixton in London. Also during 2014, Glynne collaborated on songwriting projects with Little Mix, MO, Rudimental, and Tinie Tempah. A second collaboration with Clean Bandit, ""Real Love"", was released in November 2014 and reached number two in the UK.

Glynne's second solo single ""Hold My Hand"" was released in March 2015. It debuted at number one in the UK, where it spent three weeks. In June 2015, Glynne was featured on ""Not Letting Go"", a single by English rapper Tinie Tempah. It also reached number one in the UK, bringing Glynne's total of UK number one singles to four. She underwent surgery on her vocal cords in mid 2015 and consequently cancelled several live performances, including the Glastonbury Festival. Glynne's debut album I Cry When I Laugh was released in the UK in August 2015, following the number one single ""Don't Be So Hard on Yourself"". It features contributions from Knox Brown, Naughty Boy, Starsmith, Talay Riley, and Switch, as well as her regular collaborators Bless Beats and Jin Jin. I Cry When I Laugh entered the UK Albums Chart at number one and later received a triple Platinum certification.

In October 2015, Glynne appeared on the twelfth series of The X Factor as a guest judge at Cheryl's Judges' Houses segment. The same month, she presented the Vice magazine-produced documentary film The Brit Invasion, which documented the rise of EDM and British dance music in the United States. Glynne's track ""Take Me Home"" was released as the official Children in Need 2015 charity single in November and peaked at number six in the UK, becoming Glynne's eighth overall top ten single in the country. Glynne embarked on her first UK arena tour in November, titled the Take Me Home Tour.In October 2016 and later in 2017, it was reported that Glynne was working with some ""big"" producers for her second album, including Ed Sheeran. One of the songs recorded was ""Woman Like Me"", which was later given to the band Little Mix for their fifth studio album LM5. In January 2018, Glynne featured on Rudimental's single ""These Days"" alongside American rapper Macklemore and Dan Caplen. The song was a commercial success, initially charting at number two for seven consecutive weeks behind ""God's Plan"" by Drake, before claiming the number one position in March. With this achievement, Glynne became the first British female solo artist in UK chart history to have six number-one singles. In May, Glynne performed at BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend in Swansea. Later that month, the lead single ""I'll Be There"" from her second album was released. The song later reached number one in June, becoming Glynne's seventh chart-topping single of her career. In August, second single ""All I Am"" was released and charted at number seven in the UK. The following month, the album Always in Between was released, becoming Glynne's second number one album. Her third single ""Thursday"" was released in October 2018 and has peaked at number three in the UK.

Glynne embarked on her Always in Between Tour from November 2018, covering Europe, the UK and the United States, over 50 dates. Many of the tour dates on the United States leg of the tour included Leon Bridges as a featured Artist. Also in November 2018, Glynne was announced as a special guest on the Spice Girls' reunion stadium tour, held in 2019. Glynne was due to perform at BBC Radio1 Big Weekend in 2019 however dropped out at last minute.

At the 2019 Brit Awards Glynne received five nominations, including Best British Female and Best British Single with both ""These Days"" and ""I'll Be There"".

In June 2019 Glynne received a lifetime ban from the Isle of Wight Festival when she canceled her set, giving only 10 minutes warning. The singer confessed that her reason for canceling was after a heavy night (""It is true that I went out and celebrated the end of the Spice World tour."") and, later that month, cancelled a number of gigs ""on the advice of her vocal surgeon"", including a headline performance at the Rochester Castle Concerts. However, the ban was revoked less than a year later.","

Alison Goldfrapp,"Goldfrapp was born on 13 May 1966, in Enfield, London, the youngest of six children. Her mother, Isabella Barge, was a nurse. Her father, Nicholas Goldfrapp, had been an army officer, and worked in advertising. Goldfrapp's surname is of German origin, and she has German ancestry through her father. While Goldfrapp was growing up, her family moved frequently, eventually settling in Alton, Hampshire, where Goldfrapp attended the independent Alton Convent School. She sang in a choir at the school and has said that she loved being in a school with nuns. However she was forced to leave at age 11 due to failing the senior exam, and attended the local comprehensive school, Amery Hill School. She moved into a squat in London aged 16. At 24 years old, she attended Middlesex University where she studied fine art and mixed media.","In 1994, she featured on the Orbital album Snivilisation and recorded songs ""The Good"" and ""The Bad"" with trip reggae outfit Dreadzone, for their 'best of' album The Best of Dreadzone – The Good The Bad and the Dread. Performing with them live resulted in two songs on the limited edition Performance album released in 1994. In the same year Goldfrapp featured on trip hop artist Tricky's 1995 song ""Pumpkin"" and collaborated with Stefan Girardet on two songs on the soundtrack to the 1995 film The Confessional.

Goldfrapp was introduced to composer Will Gregory in 1999 after he had listened to her vocal contribution for ""Pumpkin"", they then formed Goldfrapp and signed to Mute Records.

In 2000 she was a featured vocalist on the songs ""The Time Of The Turning"" and ""The Time of the Turning (Reprise)/The Weaver's Reel"" from the release OVO, Peter Gabriel's soundtrack album to the London Millennium Dome Show.

The pair began recording their debut album over a six-month period, beginning in September 1999, in a rented bungalow in the Wiltshire countryside. The band's debut album Felt Mountain was released in 2000 and featured Goldfrapp's synthesized vocals over cinematic soundscapes. Goldfrapp released their second album Black Cherry in 2003. The band recorded the album in Bath, England. This album focused more heavily on dance music and glam rock-inspired synths than its predecessor. Black Cherry peaked at number nineteen on the UK Albums Chart and sold 52,000 copies in the US. Supernature, Goldfrapp's third album, was released in 2005. The album comprises pop and electronic dance music prominently featured on Black Cherry, but focuses more on subtle hooks instead of the large choruses that made up its predecessor. It has sold one million copies worldwide and earned the duo two nominations at the 2007 Grammy Awards for Best Electronic/Dance Album and Best Dance Recording for the song ""Ooh La La"". Seventh Tree, Goldfrapp's fourth album, was released in 2008 and debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart. The album is a departure from the pop and electronic dance music featured on Supernature, featuring ambient and downtempo music. The band were inspired by an acoustic radio session they had performed, which led the duo to incorporate acoustic guitars into their music to create ""warm"" and ""delicate"" sounds.

In 2009, she was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Music degree by the University of Portsmouth.

Goldfrapp have released seven albums, most recently Silver Eye in 2017. Hits include ""Strict Machine"", ""Ooh La La"", ""Lovely Head"" and ""A&E"". The multi-platinum selling band have been nominated for the Mercury Prize, multiple Grammy Awards and won an Ivor Novello for ""Strict Machine"".

Goldfrapp scored the films My Summer of Love and Nowhere Boy.

In recent years, Goldfrapp has dedicated more time to her role as a photographer and director. She created and photographed the album artwork for Silver Eye and directed videos for singles ""Systemagic"", ""Everything Is Never Enough"" and ""Ocean"".

In September 2021, Goldfrapp were awarded the Ivor Novello 'Inspiration Award' which celebrates ""peer recognition for the excellence of Goldfrapp songwriting catalogue and in particular how it has inspired the creative talent of other creators"".",N/A,N/A,English musician and record producer,13/4/1966,1989–present,"Electronic

Rachel Goswell,"Goswell was born in Fareham, Hampshire, England. Her family relocated to Wales after her birth, and later to Reading, Berkshire when she was seven, where she spent the remainder of her youth. She is the second of two children, with one older brother.

Her father taught her folk guitar songs beginning at age seven, and she began studying classical guitar and music theory at age ten. Goswell took classical guitar lessons along with childhood friend Neil Halstead, with whom she formed Slowdive in 1989. Regarding her musical influences, she stated: ""For me personally, from a singing point of view, I was inspired by Siouxsie Sioux"", ""it was [her] who made me want to be a singer."" Joni Mitchell, Iggy Pop and Nick Cave were her other favorite singers. Goswell is also inspired by the Cocteau Twins; she discovered their music at 16 and ""found myself immersed in the magic and wonder of their overall sound musically."" The songs that influenced her the most were: ""There Is A Light That Never Goes Out"" by The Smiths, ""92 Degrees"" from Siouxsie and the Banshees' Tinderbox album, ""Persephone"" from Cocteau Twins' Treasure album and ""River"" from Joni Mitchell's Blue album.","Goswell formed the indie rock band the Pumpkin Fairies with Neil Halstead, Adrien Sell and Nick Chaplin in 1988, after having played in several cover bands in Reading. When the Pumpkin Fairies dissolved in 1989, the group then formed Slowdive in the same year. She was a member in Slowdive until the band's dissolution in 1995. After the disbandment, Goswell and Halstead formed Mojave 3, an offshoot of Slowdive; the group captured a more folk rock-oriented sound as opposed to Slowdive's shoegaze sound. They released five albums, their last being Puzzles Like You in 2006, before going on a hiatus.

The year 2004 saw Goswell release solo recordings with co-writer Joe Light and producer David Naughton. Nine months after Mojave 3 released Spoon and Rafter, she released The Sleep Shelter EP. Waves Are Universal, her first full-length recording, appeared a month later. Tiny Mix Tapes described the record as ""delicate and well-thought out"" despite occasionally veering towards ""the frankly repulsive world of adult contemporary"" while Pitchfork Media thought the album was ""warm [and] summery ... agreeable, if not very exciting"". Stylus Magazine stated that Waves Are Universal is ""a solid album that could appeal to both fans of [Goswell's] previous work and others"". In February 2005, a limited edition remix 12"" (also available as a download) entitled Coastline/Plucked was issued and features two mixes apiece from the Earlies and Ulrich Schnauss.

In 2014, Slowdive, with Goswell, reformed for gigs and have declared in interviews that they would be working on new material. The band continue to tour. In 2016 Goswell joined Stuart Braithwaite, Justin Lockey and James Lockey to form the band Minor Victories. Their self-titled debut was released in June 2016 on Fat Possum Records.

In April 2019, Goswell and her husband Steve Clarke announced a new musical project called the Soft Cavalry. On 5 July 2019, the duo released their self titled EP, which since then has been acclaimed by critics.","

The Independent's review calls the album ""blunt and bold"" with a ""dark sexual energy"" on which ""Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals"".

Sarah Harding,"Harding was born Sarah Nicole Hardman on 17 November 1981 in Ascot, Berkshire. She attended St Cuthbert's Primary School in Egham until 1993. She was raised with two half brothers and moved to Stockport when she was 14 after her parents' separation. Harding's father had begun dating a younger woman, she therefore disowned her father and changed her surname to Harding. She attended Hazel Grove High School from 1993 to 1998 and later attended Stockport College where she studied hair and beauty. She then worked as part of the promotions team for two nightclubs in The Grand Central Leisure Park in Stockport, as a waitress at Pizza Hut, a van driver, debt collector and as a BT telephone operator. She also toured North West England performing at pubs, social clubs and caravan parks to support herself. In 2002, she was recording dance tracks when she decided to audition for UK talent-search shows. She auditioned for Fame Academy and Popstars: The Rivals. It was in the latter on which she found fame, pulling out of Fame Academy after being accepted into the first round of Popstars. Harding also entered FHMs High Street Honeys 2002, the magazine's national beauty contest. Her pictures appeared in the top 100, but Harding withdrew upon achieving success on Popstars.","In 2002, Harding auditioned for the reality television show Popstars: The Rivals. The programme, the second British series of the international Popstars franchise, would see the creation of two rival groups – a boy band and a girl group each consisting of five members, which would then compete against each other for the 2002 Christmas Number One spot on the UK Singles Chart. Several thousand applicants attended auditions across the UK in hope of being selected. Ten girls and ten boys were chosen as finalists by judges Pete Waterman, Louis Walsh and Geri Halliwell. These finalists then took to the stage participating in weekly Saturday night live performances (alternating weekly between the girls and boys). Each week the contestant polling the fewest phone votes was eliminated, until the final line-ups of the groups emerged. Harding joined Nadine Coyle, Cheryl Tweedy, Nicola Roberts and Kimberley Walsh to comprise the new girl group Girls Aloud, formed through the show by a public vote on 30 November 2002.

The group's debut single ""Sound of the Underground"" peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the 2002 Christmas number one. Girls Aloud hold the record for the shortest time between formation and reaching number one. The group released their debut album Sound of the Underground in May 2003, which entered the charts at number two and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) later the same year. Their singles ""I'll Stand by You"", ""Walk This Way"" and ""The Promise"" have charted at number one. Two of their albums have reached the top of the UK Albums Chart: their greatest hits album The Sound of Girls Aloud and 2008's Out of Control, both of which entered the chart at number one, with over one million copies of the former being sold. They also achieved seven certified albums and have been nominated for five Brit Awards, winning the 2009 Best Single for ""The Promise"".

The group's musical style was pop, but throughout their career they experimented with electropop and dance-pop. Girls Aloud's collaborations with Brian Higgins and his songwriting and production team Xenomania earned the group critical acclaim, due to an innovative approach to mainstream pop music. The group became one of the few UK reality television acts to achieve continued success, amassing a fortune of £30 million by May 2010. Guinness World Records lists them as ""Most Successful Reality TV Group"" in the 2007 edition. They also hold the record for ""Most Consecutive Top Ten Entries in the UK by a Female Group"" in the 2008 edition and are credited again for ""Most Successful Reality TV Group"" in the 2011 edition. The group was also named the United Kingdom's biggest selling girl group of the 21st century, with over 4.3 million singles sales and 4 million albums sold in the UK alone. In 2006, Harding signed a £100,000 deal to model Ultimo lingerie, following the likes of Penny Lancaster, Rachel Hunter and Helena Christensen. Alongside her Girls Aloud bandmates, Harding made a cameo appearance in St. Trinian's in 2007. She took on her first major acting role in 2008, appearing in the low-budget thriller Bad Day. Harding wore a brunette wig for the role of Jade Jennings. The film also stars Donna Air and Claire Goose. She also collaborated with London synthpop band Filthy Dukes on a cover of ""Real Wild Child"", recorded for the film Wild Child. In July 2009, Girls Aloud announced they would take a year-long hiatus to pursue solo projects, but would reunite for a new studio album in 2010.

During Girls Aloud's hiatus, Harding decided to focus on her acting career. ""Singing was always my main ambition, but acting was something else I wanted to achieve"", Harding said. Harding appeared in the BBC television film Freefall, written and directed by Dominic Savage. The film aired on BBC Two on 14 July 2009. Harding portrayed Sam, the beautician girlfriend of Dominic Cooper's character. The drama is a satirical take on the financial crisis of 2007–2008. Company magazine said that ""Sarah Harding showed she's got real acting potential in her convincing, but fleeting performance.""

Later that year, Harding returned to the St. Trinian's franchise with a starring role in St. Trinian's 2: The Legend of Fritton's Gold. Despite her age, Harding portrayed teenage rebel Roxy, a new student at St. Trinian's School. The film received overwhelmingly negative reviews, holding a 10% 'rotten' rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Harding worked with Girls Aloud producers Xenomania to record three solo tracks for the film's soundtrack – ""Too Bad"", ""Make It Easy"" and a cover of David Bowie's ""Boys Keep Swinging"".

In December 2009, Harding appeared on MTV's Sarah Harding in 24 Hours. Harding and her then-boyfriend, DJ Tom Crayne, also launched a new nightclub named Kanaloa. Harding's guest vocals appear alongside Kanobby on the Roger Sanchez and Far East Movement track ""2Gether""; she also appears in snippets of the music video. Harding then filmed Run for Your Wife in which she played one of the wives of the lead character, John Smith. The film was released on 14 February 2013.

After three years of hiatus, Girls Aloud reunited in 2012 to celebrate their tenth anniversary together. The group released the single ""Something New"" in November, with proceeds being donated to Children in Need. Their second greatest hits anthology Ten was released on 26 November 2012, followed by the single ""Beautiful Cause You Love Me"". In 2013, the group embarked on Ten: The Hits Tour. Shortly after the tour, the group announced their split.

Harding first revealed that she was working on her debut album in March 2010. She named Lady Gaga as her biggest influence. Despite this, an album never materialised. Harding restated her plans to release a solo album in 2013 and said that she had been ""writing and experimenting with different sounds in the studio."" In an interview in 2014. She said, ""I'm doing all sorts of stuff at the moment [...] A lot of it is music, music, music."". In July 2015 her first solo release, ""Threads"", was announced; it was released on 7 August.

She made a guest appearance on the ITV soap opera Coronation Street as Joni Preston, the wife of Robert Preston (Tristan Gemmill). The character made a few appearances in July and August 2015 as her marriage to Robert disintegrated when he began an affair with ex-wife Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford).

Harding competed on the BBC's Saturday night gymnastics show Tumble in 2014 where she came third. She also participated in season 10 of BBC's Celebrity MasterChef in 2015. She took part on the third series of The Jump on Channel 4 in early 2016, withdrawing on 26 February (Week 5) after tearing a ligament in her knee during a training session. In Autumn 2016, Harding appeared alongside Andy Moss in a UK tour of Ghost: The Musical. However, she was replaced mid tour by Carolyn Maitland after pulling out due to the subsequent pain from her injury after The Jump. In August 2017, Harding won the twentieth series of Celebrity Big Brother.

On 24 March 2021, Harding released her final single, ""Wear It Like a Crown"", which she had recorded ten years earlier. However, she had found it and decided to release it with the profits going towards her chosen charity. The same day, the song went straight to number 1 on the iTunes chart.","Threads—* Released: 7 August 2015 * Label: Underdog Management Limited * Formats: digital download,""Threads""—2015—Threads,""Wear It Like a Crown""—2021—Non-album single,""Real Wild Child""—2008—Wild Child (soundtrack)—A cover of Johnny O'Keefe's song.,""Too Bad""—2009—St. Trinian's 2: The Legend of Fritton's Gold (soundtrack),""Make It Easy""—2009—St. Trinian's 2: The Legend of Fritton's Gold (soundtrack),""Boys Keep Swinging""—2009—St. Trinian's 2: The Legend of Fritton's Gold (soundtrack)—A cover of David Bowie's song.,""2gether"" (Roger Sanchez and Far East Movement featuring Kanobby)—2011—Free Wired—Harding provided uncredited guest vocals.

Bella Hardy,N/A,"Bella Hardy is from Edale in Derbyshire's Dark Peak where there is an abundance of communal song. Born into a family of singers, Hardy began singing locally at an early age. Having played the fiddle a small amount at school, she attended a Folkworks Youth Summer School in Durham aged 13. Motivated by the number of young people playing folk music, she began working on folk fiddle. She also met the 11 musicians who formed The Pack. This 12 piece band toured across the summer folk scene, and they played on the Cambridge Folk Festival main stage in 2003. In 2002, The Pack's only album 12 Little Devils was released, with fRoots calling it ""... a genuine feel good album. Get yours now!"". The Pack performed for ten years before disbanding in 2007. In 2004 she was a finalist in BBC Radio 2's Young Folk as a solo artist.

Hardy released her debut solo album Night Visiting in 2007, to critical acclaim. Mojo gave her a 4* 'Brilliant' rating, fRoots wrote ""Bella Hardy is more than a new generation folk revivalist... Her potential is massive"", and Taplas Magazine noted ""...her debut CD solo album is a piece of wondrous beauty and inventive incisiveness"". The following year she was nominated for the Horizon Award at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. She was also nominated for Best Original Song the same year with Three Black Feathers, which Jim Moray went on to record on his 2008 album Low Culture.

In July 2008 she performed in two concerts at London's Royal Albert Hall as part of the first Folk Prom. She opened the event with a set of unaccompanied traditional songs and played an evening concert with long-time touring companion Chris Sherburn (concertina) and Corrina Hewat (harp). The programme was broadcast simultaneously by BBC Four and Radio 3. Other TV appearances include The Truth about Carols (2008), a Christmas Day BBC Two show on which she sang 'The Coventry Carol', and BBC One's Songs of Praise in February 2010 singing her own version of 'The Lord's my Shepherd'.

Hardy released her second solo album In The Shadow of Mountains in 2009 at the Cambridge Folk Festival. Again it gained critical acclaim. English Dance and Song Magazine wrote ""It's astounding and somewhat daunting to realise this is only Bella's second album... Surely no-one has any right to be writing songs with the sophistication of 'Sylvie Sovay', so early in their career...lyrical portraiture that brings to mind no less than Lennon and McCartney"", and R2 Magazine noted ""Bella's debut album Night Visiting was excellent, but In The Shadow of Mountains is stunning"".

Hardy has released a total of nine solo records, all to critical acclaim. She has also collaborated on a number of projects, including Carthy, Hardy, Farrell, & Young with Eliza Carthy, and The Elizabethan Session with John Smith and Martin Simpson. In 2015, Hardy was British Council Musician in Residence in Yunnan, China, where she returned in 2017 to create the album Eternal Spring. She spent a year in Tennessee as a ranch hand, looking after horses and immersing herself in the music culture of Nashville.

A double CD, Postcards & Pocketbooks: The Best of Bella Hardy was released in 2019 to celebrate the first part of Hardy's career. It was accompanied by a hardback book with the lyrics of the over a hundred self-penned songs she released during this time.

On 17 June 2019, she appeared on the podcast Trees A Crowd with David Oakes – for which Bella also composed the theme tune.","Solo:

Sinéad Harnett,N/A,"Born to a Thai mother and an Irish father, Harnett grew up in Finchley, north London. She attended Arts University College Bournemouth, where she studied for a degree in acting and appeared in student productions of plays such as One Thousand and One Nights.

Harnett gained prominence as a singer in 2011 when, following an open request to her Twitter followers for suggestions and applicants, grime artist Wiley selected Harnett to feature on the single ""Walk Away"" from his album Chill Out Zone. In 2012, she was featured on the Disclosure track ""Boiling"" from their EP The Face. She released her debut single, ""Got Me"", in 2013 via Black Butter Records, and contributed songwriting and guest vocals to Rudimental's debut album, Home. She was also featured on Ryan Hemsworth's solo album Guilt Trips, on the opening track ""Small + Lost"", and provided uncredited vocals for Kidnap Kid's single ""So Close"".

Her debut EP, N.O.W., was released in August 2014 through 333 Records; it includes the single ""No Other Way"", which The Guardian named track of the week. Another track on the EP, ""Paradise"", received the same honour from The Huffington Post. Snakehips, who are featured on ""No Other Way"", featured Harnett on their single ""Days with You"". By late 2014, she was recording her debut album with producer Chris Loco for release on Virgin EMI Records, and was shortlisted for MTV UK's Brand New for 2015 award. The album was originally due for release in 2015 and also features contributions from James Fauntleroy, Chloe Martini, KOZ, TMS, and Two Inch Punch. Its first single, ""She Ain't Me"", was released in June 2015, followed by ""Do It Anyway"" in September 2015.

In early 2016, Harnett featured on the single ""Never Say Never?"" by rapper Nick Brewer. In August, she released the EP Sinead Harnett via Rinse FM; it features collaborations with GRADES, JD. Reid, Kaytranada, and Snakehips, and has produced the singles ""If You Let Me"" and ""Rather Be with You"".

Victoria Hart,N/A,"Hart studied vocals at London music school Vocaltech (Part of Tech Music Schools). She attended an International School in Mougins and finished her GCSEs in the summer of 2004. Having finished school and exams for the summer, she sang jazz to friends and family.

At age 15, while living with her parents in France, she was heard singing at a party in a vineyard by producer Geoff Gurd, who was so impressed he took her under his wing and began recording her.

Shortly afterward Hart recorded for the first time at Gurd's recording studio. Gurd has written several songs specifically for Hart. Hart, Gurd and Lynne Pearson formed a team of singer, writer/producer and manager who, together with a promotional team, developed Hart's debut album released in June 2007.

In May 2006 she performed at the Cannes Film Festival, Alex Proud heard Hart perform at the Pangea Club and later invited her to sing at the opening night of his new bar and gallery in London, At Proud. The audience included journalists and club owners and from this she was asked to perform at The Pigalle Club, in Piccadilly in London. Hart supported the Blue Harlem group.

In 2007, while working as a singing waitress at the Naked Turtle restaurant in London, the 18-year-old Hart was invited to perform for a benefit party during the Cannes Film Festival hosted by George Clooney and other stars, including Brad Pitt. The story was a press sensation and not soon after Hart had signed a purportedly $1m contract with Decca Records. This led to the ""singing waitress"" nickname.

Her debut album Whatever Happened to Romance was released on 30 June 2007 and peaked at the number 22 position on the Billboard Top Jazz Album list. On 27 October 2008 she released The Lost Gershwin, an album of lesser-known songs by George Gershwin. The string quartet Pavao provides backup.In July 2007, Hart performed at the three-day jazz festival at Woburn.

On 1 June 2008, Hart performed at the Southport International Jazz Festival.

During June and July 2008, Hart appeared as the special guest of tenor Russell Watson on his United Kingdom tour. She performed two songs solo and one duet with Watson.

She also performed live on The Today Show on 5 July 2008.

In December 2008, Hart made an impromptu guest appearance with the Guards Big Band at a Super Busking gig in London's Covent Garden as part of Covent Garden's Christmas Delight celebrations. The performance took place in-sync with a visual light display by United Visual Artists in aid of homeless charity Crisis.

In 2009, Hart performed before British troops in Afghanistan.

In February 2010, Hart appeared at the King's Head Theatre, Islington, as a guest artist in Taboo-Be-Do! Hits and Misses from the Politically Incorrect Songbook, a show compiled and performed by Terence Blacker and Derek Hewitson of the duo Something Happened. The show was performed at festivals, including the Hay Festival, and the Aldeburgh Literary Festival.","

PJ Harvey,"Polly Jean Harvey was born on 9 October 1969 in Bridport, Dorset, the second child of Ray and Eva Harvey. Her parents owned a quarrying business, and she grew up on the family farm in Corscombe. During her childhood, she attended school in nearby Beaminster, where she received guitar lessons from folk singer-songwriter Steve Knightley. Her parents introduced her to music that would later influence her work, including blues, Captain Beefheart and Bob Dylan. Her parents were avid music fans and regularly arranged get-togethers and small gigs, counting Ian Stewart among their oldest friends.

As a teenager, Harvey began learning saxophone and joined an eight-piece instrumental group Bologne, run by composer Andrew Dickson. She was also a guitarist with folk duo the Polekats, with whom she wrote some of her earliest material. After finishing school, she joined Yeovil College and attended a visual arts foundation course.","In July 1988, Harvey became a member of Automatic Dlamini, a band based in Bristol with whom she gained extensive ensemble-playing experience. Formed by John Parish in 1983, the band consisted of a rotating line-up that at various times included Rob Ellis and Ian Oliver. Harvey had met Parish in 1987 through mutual friend Jeremy Hogg, the band's slide guitarist. Providing saxophone, guitars and background vocals, she travelled extensively during the band's early days, including performances in East and West Germany, Spain and Poland to support the band's debut studio album, The D is for Drum. A second European tour took place throughout June and July 1989. Following the tour, the band recorded Here Catch, Shouted His Father, their second studio album, between late 1989 and early 1990. This is the only Automatic Dlamini material to feature Harvey, but remains unreleased, although bootleg versions of the album are in circulation.

In January 1991, Harvey left to form her own band with former bandmates Ellis and Oliver; yet she had formed lasting personal and professional relationships with certain members, especially Parish, whom she has referred to as her ""musical soulmate."" Parish would subsequently contribute to, and sometimes co-produce, Harvey's solo studio albums and has toured with her a number of times. As a duo, Parish and Harvey have recorded two collaborative albums where Parish composed the music and Harvey wrote the lyrics. Additionally, Parish's girlfriend in the late 1980s was photographer Maria Mochnacz. She and Harvey became close friends and Mochnacz went on to shoot and design most of Harvey's album artwork and music videos, contributing significantly to her public image.

Harvey has said of her time with Automatic Dlamini: ""I ended up not singing very much but I was just happy to learn how to play the guitar. I wrote a lot during the time I was with them but my first songs were crap. I was listening to a lot of Irish folk music at the time, so the songs were folky and full of penny whistles and stuff. It was ages before I felt ready to perform my own songs in front of other people."" She also credits Parish for teaching her how to perform in front of audiences, saying ""after the experience with John's band and seeing him perform I found it was enormously helpful to me as a performer to engage with people in the audience, and I probably did learn that from him, amongst other things.""In January 1991, following her departure from Automatic Dlamini, Harvey formed her own band with former bandmates Rob Ellis and Ian Oliver. Harvey decided to name the trio PJ Harvey after rejecting other names as ""nothing felt right at all or just suggested the wrong type of sound"", and also to allow her to continue music as a solo artist. The trio consisted of Harvey on vocals and guitar, Ellis on drums and backing vocals, and Oliver on bass. Oliver later departed to rejoin the still-active Automatic Dlamini. He was subsequently replaced with Steve Vaughan. The trio's ""disastrous"" debut performance was held at a skittle alley in Charmouth Village Hall in April 1991. Harvey later recounted the event saying: ""we started playing and I suppose there was about fifty people there, and during the first song we cleared the hall. There was only about two people left. And a woman came up to us, came up to my drummer, it was only a three piece, while we were playing and shouted at him 'Don't you realise nobody likes you! We'll pay you, you can stop playing, we'll still pay you!'"" The group relocated to London in June 1991 when Harvey applied to study sculpture, still undecided as to her future career. During this time, the group recorded a set of demo songs and distributed them to record labels. Independent label Too Pure agreed to release the band's debut single ""Dress"" in October 1991, and later signed PJ Harvey. ""Dress"" received mass critical acclaim upon its release and was voted Single of the Week in Melody Maker by guest reviewer John Peel, who admired ""the way Polly Jean seems crushed by the weight of her own songs and arrangements, as if the air is literally being sucked out of them ... admirable if not always enjoyable."" However, Too Pure provided little promotion for the single and critics claim that ""Melody Maker had more to do with the success of the ""Dress"" single than Too Pure Records."" A week after its release, the band recorded a live radio session for Peel on BBC Radio 1 on 29 October featuring ""Oh, My Lover"", ""Victory"", ""Sheela-Na-Gig"" and ""Water"".

The following February, the trio released ""Sheela-Na-Gig"" as their equally-acclaimed second single and their debut studio album, Dry (1992), followed in March. Like the singles preceding it, Dry received an overwhelming international critical response. The album was cited by Kurt Cobain of Nirvana as his sixteenth-favourite album ever in his posthumously-published Journals. Rolling Stone also named Harvey as Songwriter of the Year and Best New Female Singer. A limited edition double LP version of Dry was released alongside the regular version of the album, containing both the original and demo versions of each track, called Dry Demonstration, and the band also received significant coverage at the Reading Festival in 1992.

Island (PolyGram) signed the trio amid a major label bidding war in mid-1992, and in December 1992 the trio travelled to Cannon Falls, Minnesota in the United States to record the follow-up to Dry with producer Steve Albini. Prior to recording with Albini, the band recorded a second session with John Peel on 22 September and recorded a version of Bob Dylan's ""Highway 61 Revisited,"" and two new songs ""Me Jane"" and ""Ecstasy."" The recording sessions with Albini took place at Pachyderm Recording Studio and resulted in the band's major label debut Rid of Me in May 1993. Rolling Stone wrote that it ""is charged with aggressive eroticism and rock fury. It careens from blues to goth to grunge, often in the space of a single song."" The album was promoted by two singles, ""50ft Queenie"" and ""Man-Size"", as well as tours of the United Kingdom in May and of the United States in June, continuing there during the summer.

However, during the American leg of the tour, internal friction started to form between the members of the trio. Deborah Frost, writing for Rolling Stone, noticed ""an ever widening personal gulf"" between the band members, and quoted Harvey as saying ""It makes me sad. I wouldn't have got here without them. I needed them back then – badly. But I don't need them anymore. We all changed as people."" Despite the tour's personal downsides, footage from live performances was compiled and released on the long-form video Reeling with PJ Harvey (1993). The band's final tour was to support U2 in August 1993, after which the trio officially disbanded. In her final appearance on American television in September 1993 on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Harvey performed a solo version of ""Rid of Me."" As Rid of Me sold substantially more copies than Dry, 4-Track Demos, a compilation album of demos for the album was released in October and inaugurated her career as a solo artist. In early 1994, it was announced that U2's manager, Paul McGuinness, had become her manager.As Harvey embarked on her solo career, she explored collaborations with other musicians. In 1995 she released her third studio album, To Bring You My Love, featuring former bandmate John Parish, Bad Seeds multi-instrumentalist Mick Harvey and French drummer Jean-Marc Butty, all of whom would continue to perform and record with Harvey throughout her career. The album was also her first material to be produced by Flood. Simultaneously a more blues-influenced and more futuristic record than its predecessors, To Bring You My Love showcased Harvey broadening her musical style to include strings, organs and synthesisers. Rolling Stone said in its review that ""Harvey sings the blues like Nick Cave sings gospel: with more distortion, sex and murder than you remember. To Bring You My Love was a towering goth version of grunge."" During the successive tours for the album, Harvey also experimented with her image and stage persona.

The record generated a surprise modern rock radio hit in the United States with its lead single, ""Down by the Water."" Three consecutive singles—""C'mon Billy"", ""Send His Love to Me"" and ""Long Snake Moan""—were also moderately successful. The album was a commercial success selling one million copies worldwide including 370,000 in the United States. It was also certified Silver in the United Kingdom within seven months of its release, having sold over 60,000 copies. In the United States, the album was voted Album of the Year by The Village Voice, Rolling Stone, USA Today, People, The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times. Rolling Stone also named Harvey 1995's Artist of the Year and Spin ranked the album third in The 90 Greatest Albums of the 1990s, behind Nirvana's Nevermind (1991) and Public Enemy's Fear of a Black Planet (1990).

In July 2020, a vinyl reissue of To Bring You My Love was announced which includes unreleased demos.

In 1996, following the international success of To Bring You My Love and other collaborations, Harvey began composing material that would end up on her fourth studio album, during what she referred to as ""an incredibly low patch."" The material diverged significantly from her former work and introduced electronica elements into her song-writing. During recording sessions in 1997 original PJ Harvey Trio drummer Rob Ellis rejoined Harvey's band, and Flood was hired again as producer. The sessions, which continued into April the following year, resulted in Is This Desire? (1998). Though originally released to mixed reviews in September 1998, the album was a success and received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Alternative Music Performance. The album's lead single, ""A Perfect Day Elise,"" was moderately successful in the United Kingdom, peaking at number 25 on the UK Singles Chart, her most successful single to date.In early 2000, Harvey began work on her fifth studio album Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea with Rob Ellis and Mick Harvey. Written in her native Dorset, Paris and New York, the album showcased a more mainstream indie rock and pop rock sound to her previous albums and the lyrics followed themes of love that tied into Harvey's affection for New York City. The album also featured Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke on three tracks, including his lead vocals on ""This Mess We're in."" Upon its release in October 2000 the album was a critical and commercial success, selling over one million copies worldwide and charting in both the United Kingdom and the United States. The album's three singles—""Good Fortune"", ""A Place Called Home"" and ""This Is Love""—were moderately successful.

The album also received a number of accolades including a BRIT Award nomination for Best Female Artist and two Grammy Award nominations for Best Rock Album and Best Female Rock Performance for the album's third single, ""This Is Love"". However, most notably, Harvey was nominated for, and won, the 2001 Mercury Music Prize. The awards ceremony was held on the same day as the September 11 attacks on the United States and Harvey was on tour in Washington, D.C., one of the affected cities, when she won the prize. Reflecting on the win in 2011, she said: ""quite naturally I look back at that and only remember the events that were taking place across the world and to win the prize on that day—it didn't have much importance in the grand scheme of things"", noting ""it was a very surreal day"". The same year, Harvey also topped a readers' poll conducted by Q Magazine of the 100 Greatest Women in Rock Music.

During three years of various collaborations with other artists, Harvey was also working on her sixth studio album, Uh Huh Her, which was released in May 2004. For the first time since 4-Track Demos (1993), Harvey played every instrument—with the exception of drums provided by Rob Ellis—and was the sole producer. The album received ""generally favourable reviews"" by critics, though its production was often criticised. It was also a commercial success, debuting and peaking at number 12 in the UK Albums Chart and being certified Silver by the BPI within a month of its release.

Harvey also did an extensive world tour in promotion of the album, lasting seven months in total. Selected recordings from the tour were included on Harvey's first live DVD, On Tour: Please Leave Quietly, directed by Maria Mochnacz and released in 2006.During her first performance since the Uh Huh Her tour at the Hay Festival of Literature & Arts on 26 May 2006, Harvey revealed that her next studio album would be almost entirely piano-based. Following the October release of The Peel Sessions 1991–2004, a compilation of songs recorded from 1991 to 2000 during her radio sessions with John Peel, she began recording her seventh studio album White Chalk in November, together with Flood, John Parish and Eric Drew Feldman and drummer Jim White in a studio in West London. White Chalk was released in September 2007 and marked a radical departure from her usual alternative rock style, consisting mainly of piano ballads. The album received favourable reviews, its style being described by one critic as containing ""pseudo-Victorian elements—drama, restraint, and antiquated instruments and sounds."" Harvey herself said of the album: ""when I listen to the record I feel in a different universe, really, and I'm not sure whether it's in the past or in the future. The record confuses me, that's what I like—it doesn't feel of this time right now, but I'm not sure whether it's 100 years ago or 100 years in the future"", summing up the album's sound as ""really weird."" During the tour for the album Harvey performed without a backing band, and also began performing on an autoharp, which continues to be her primary instrument after guitar and has influenced her material since White Chalk.

In April 2010, Harvey appeared on The Andrew Marr Show to perform a new song titled ""Let England Shake."" In a pre-performance interview with Marr, she stated that the new material she had written had been ""formed out of the landscape that I've grown up in and the history of this nation"" and as ""a human being affected by politics."" Her eighth studio album Let England Shake was released in February 2011, and received universal critical acclaim. NMEs 10/10 review summarised the album as ""a record that ventures deep into the heart of darkness of war itself and its resonance throughout England's past, present and future"" and other reviews also noted its themes and writing style as ""bloody and forceful,"" mixing ""ethereal form with brutal content,"" and ""her most powerful."" Dealing with the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan and other episodes from English history, the album featured John Parish, Mick Harvey and Jean-Marc Butty as Harvey's backing band and the quartet toured extensively in its promotion. Following the release of the album's two well-received singles—""The Words That Maketh Murder"" and ""The Glorious Land""—and the collection of short films by Seamus Murphy to accompany the album, Harvey won her second Mercury Music Prize on 6 September. The award marked her as the first artist to receive the award twice, entering her into The Guinness Book of Records as the only artist to have achieved this., and sales of Let England Shake increased 1,190% overnight following her win. On 23 September, Let England Shake was certified Gold in the United Kingdom and was listed as album of the year by MOJO and Uncut.

On 3 August 2013, Harvey released a song Shaker Aamer in support of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp detainee by the same name who was the last British citizen to be held there. The song describes in detail what Aamer endured during his four-month hunger strike.On 16 January 2015, PJ Harvey began recording her ninth studio album, The Hope Six Demolition Project, in front of a live audience. A custom built recording studio was made in London's Somerset House. Uncut magazine noted that much like her previous album Let England Shake, many of the lyrics were politically charged, but this time it was more globally focused. While recording she was shown to be using saxophones, an autoharp and a bouzouki. Flood was confirmed to be the producer of the album. On 18 December 2015, Harvey released a 20-second teaser for the album, which contained a release date of spring 2016.

On 21 January 2016, the debut single, ""The Wheel"", was played on Steve Lamacq's show on BBC Radio 6 Music. The album was released on 15 April. A new video, ""The Orange Monkey"", was shared on 2 June 2016. Directed by Irish filmmaker Seamus Murphy, it was made from footage of Murphy's and Harvey's trips to Afghanistan.

The album reached #1 on the UK Albums Chart and was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Alternative Music Album category. Harvey spent much of 2016 and 2017 touring the world with her nine-piece band, taking her critically lauded live show around North America, South America, Europe and Australasia.","

Ren Harvieu,N/A,"Harvieu was discovered on MySpace by a local music manager after uploading demo tracks. After being introduced to record producer Jimmy Hogarth (Amy Winehouse, Duffy) she began working on demos and was signed to Universal Music aged 18.

Harvieu started recording an album in May 2011, but before it could be released, she broke her back in what she describes as a 'freak accident', ""I heard it snap. I couldn't feel my feet,"" the singer recalled. After a 14-hour operation, Harvieu spent months recovering at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital.

On 5 December 2011, the BBC announced that Harvieu had been nominated for their BBC Sound of 2012 poll.

Marli Harwood,N/A,"In 1995, Harwood was signed by Chris Blackwell to his Island Records label. During the recording of her debut album, Blackwell decided to sell Island Records, and Harwood's album was never released. In 2002, Harwood appeared on Fame Academy, and finished eighth in the series. She then recorded several albums with various major record labels, which remained unreleased or promoted.

In January 2011, Harwood's song ""It's Called a Heart"" was played to Jeff Smith, head of music at BBC Radio 2, by her management team and on 25 January it was announced by the Press Association that the track was Record of the Week on Radio 2. Harwood released ""It's Called a Heart"" via her website on 21 February 2011.

Harwood had a maternity clause added to her recording contract, which was described as a first. With a final working date of 1 July 2011 before the birth, Island Records were pushing to get her 12-track album Clocks and Full Stops released. The single from the album, ""Billy"", was released on 30 May with the album following.

Kirsty Hawkshaw,N/A,"Kirsty Hawkshaw is the daughter of the late British production music/film music composer and disco record producer Alan Hawkshaw, who was known for composing themes for TV programmes such as Grange Hill and Channel 4 game show Countdown. Her mother is German-born Christiane Bieberbach.

At a rave in 1990, she was noticed by producers Ian Munro, Kevin Dodds and Nigel Walton, who at the time were known as A.S.K. and were signed to MCA Records UK. The trio had released a single called ""Dream"", when she was invited to appear on stage as their dancer. It was through this meeting that they would form a dance act called Opus III. Their first single, a cover version of the song ""It's a Fine Day"" from their debut album Mind Fruit, was an international success and Top 10 hit on UK Singles Chart, and reached No. 1 on the US Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 1992. A reversed sample of Hawkshaw's singing from this track was used in the Orbital track ""Halcyon"", the music video for which featured Hawkshaw. Opus III also had another US number 1 hit on the same chart in 1994 with ""When You Made the Mountain"", from their second and final album, Guru Mother.

In a 2009 interview, she recalled her decision to end her association with Opus III, saying she felt that she did not want to be part of a ""commercialized"" act, wanted to go in a different direction, and felt that she did not have sufficient input in writing and production, which led to conflict with the rest of the band; she has also ruled out any plans for a reunion if it ever happens. She has also been critical of the dance music industry more broadly, especially performers lip synching other people's songs, and using original artists' vocals without permission or credit.

After the group broke up in 1994, Hawkshaw pursued a solo career and has since been in demand by other acts in the dance, house, Eurodance, trance, and electronica community, including Tiësto, Delerium, BT, Fragma, Seba, and Paradox, among others.

Her solo single ""Fine Day"" peaked at number 62 in the UK Singles Chart in November 2002.

Hawkshaw contributed a track titled ""Telephone Song"" to the children's compilation album For the Kids Too!, released in 2004.

On 10 October 2005, she released Meta-Message, a collection of older and newer songs, after a growing interest in her out-of-print album, O.U.T.

Chanelle Hayes,"Hayes was born Chanelle Jade Sinclair in 1987 in Wythenshawe, a suburb of Manchester, England. Her mother, Andrea Sinclair, a 32-year-old prostitute, was murdered by client Keith Pollard on 5 April 1988, when Hayes was not quite five months old. Hayes was then put up for adoption and was raised in Wakefield, West Yorkshire by Christine and Harry Hayes. At age 15 she sought information about her birth family from social workers and was reunited with her grandmother and her sisters in Sheffield.","In 2007, Hayes emerged into the public eye when she appeared on the eighth series of the UK's Big Brother. Following her appearance in Big Brother, she appeared many times in newspapers and magazines doing photo shoots and interviews. On 23 November 2007, it was revealed that Hayes was voted the Favourite Big Brother Housemate Ever by the forum members of Digital Spy. She was also voted the second Sexiest Female Housemate Ever, losing by a narrow margin to Imogen Thomas.

In April 2008, Hayes was cast in a video by the creative advertising team of Lee & Dan Special Projects, who had been hired by MTV UK to produce a viral advertisement for the new MTV comedy Fur TV.

In May 2008, BBC Radio 1 declined to add her debut single to the playlist, despite interviewing her on the Chris Moyles breakfast show. In May 2008, she also topped a poll by Domino's Pizza, to find Britain's least talented celebrity. In June, she stated her ""fame may be over"" as TV producers started putting her television ideas on hold. In August the organisers of V festival reportedly declined her request to sing.

Imogen Heap,"Imogen Jennifer Heap was born on 9 December 1977 in Havering, Greater London. Her name was inspired by that of British composer Imogen Holst, as her mother wanted Heap to become a cellist like Holst. She played music from an early age, first learning the piano due to ""wanting attention"" as a middle child and realizing, according to her, that ""it was something [she] could make a lot of noise with"". She did not enjoy playing the music of classical composers such as Bach and Beethoven, and would instead attempt to play in their style to convince her parents she was practicing their music. As a child, she began recording music by recording herself playing piano on cassette, then recording herself again singing over it. She soon began taking lessons and became classically trained in several instruments including piano, cello and clarinet while attending Friends School, a private, Quaker-run boarding school in Saffron Walden. At around age 10, she began composing Christmas carols for her school's choir.

Due to being placed a year above children her age, Heap claims she did not get along with many people from the school and spent most of her time in the music room practicing piano. She stated, ""In boarding school...I was mocked about the clothes I wore, the way I looked, whatever. People there really did regard me as some kind of freak from the middle of nowhere. And these things do matter a lot when you are sixteen, seventeen."" Heap's mother (an art therapist) and father (a construction rock retailer) separated when she was twelve years old. Also at age twelve, she taught herself how to use Cubase on an Atari computer at Friends School. By the age of thirteen, she had begun writing songs. At age fifteen, she began using reel-to-reel recording to record her music, using a home computer to program the music.","After boarding school, she went on to study at the BRIT School for Performing Arts & Technology in Croydon, South London, where she first began regularly singing and writing songs due to loneliness. It was there that she recorded her first song to feature her vocals, ""Missing You"", which was released on the BRIT School's Class of 1994 album and earned her attention from manager Mickey Modern after he saw her performance at a talent showcase. After being introduced to Nik Kershaw by Modern, Heap recorded demos which were taken to Rondor Music. A few months later, Heap signed her first record contract, aged 18, with independent record label Almo Sounds.

In 1996, Heap began working with British experimental pop band Acacia, which featured her future collaborator Guy Sigsworth. While never a full member of the band, Heap was a guest vocalist and contributed to various Acacia singles and album tracks. Heap's first major live solo performance was as part of the line-up for the 1996 Prince's Trust Concert in Hyde Park.Heap's debut commercial single, ""Getting Scared"", was released in 1997. The song became the lead single from her debut album, I Megaphone, and was included in the soundtrack for the 1998 horror film I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. She released her debut album, the alternative rock record I Megaphone, on 16 June 1998 through Almo. The record was made with several producers, including English musician Dave Stewart and Sigsworth, and received some critical praise but was a commercial failure, as Almo did little to promote the album. Soon after Heap released the record, Almo Sounds was acquired by Universal, forcing its artists to either move to other labels or be released. Heap was one of the artists who was dropped from the label, leaving her without a record contract. I Megaphone had, however, been licensed from Almo Sounds to Aozora Records in Japan, who eventually re-released and re-promoted the album in January 2002, and included the bonus tracks ""Blanket"" and ""Aeroplane"".

During her time as an unsigned artist, Heap appeared on two singles: ""Meantime"", a track written by her former Acacia colleagues Guy Sigsworth and Alexander Nilere for the soundtrack to the independent British film G:MT – Greenwich Mean Time, and ""Blanket"", a 1998 collaboration with British hip hop band Urban Species. ""Blanket"" was Heap's first charting single, reaching number 56 on the UK Singles Chart. The song would later appear in a 2005 sex tape of Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst. Heap appeared as a featured vocalist on two songs—""Dirty Mind"" and ""Rollin' and Tumblin'""—on the 2001 album You Had It Coming by English guitarist Jeff Beck.Heap had kept in contact with Guy Sigsworth (who had co-written and produced ""Getting Scared"" from I Megaphone), and this led to the pair of them establishing the collaborative project Frou Frou.

The initial concept for Frou Frou was Sigsworth's, and the project was to have been an album written and produced by her with each track featuring a different singer, songwriter, poet or rapper. Heap explains that Sigsworth invited her over to his studio to write lyrics to a four-bar motif he had, with one condition – that she include the word ""love"" somewhere. The first line she came up with was ""lung of love, leaves me breathless"", and the Details album track ""Flicks"" was written. A week later, Sigsworth called Heap again, and together they wrote and recorded the future single ""Breathe In"".

On 4 June 2002, they released Details, their first and only album to date. The album spawned the singles ""Breathe In"", ""It's Good to Be in Love"" and ""Must Be Dreaming"". The song ""Let Go"" was featured on the soundtrack for the 2004 film Garden State.

In late 2003, after an extensive promotional tour of the UK, Europe and the US, the duo was told that their record label Island Records would not be picking up the option for a second album.

Heap and Sigsworth remain firm friends and have worked together since the project, including their temporary re-formation in late 2003, when they covered the Bonnie Tyler classic ""Holding Out for a Hero"" which was featured during the credits of the movie Shrek 2 after Jennifer Saunders' version in the film. Frou Frou saw a resurgence in popularity in 2004, when their album track ""Let Go"" was featured in the film Garden State, the soundtrack of which won a Grammy award.

In a 2005 interview, Heap said of Frou Frou, ""[It] was really like a kind of little holiday from my own work. Guy and I, we have always worked together, and then over the years, it became clear that we wanted to do a whole album together. It was very organic and spontaneous – just one of those wonderful things that happens. But there was never a mention of a second record from either of us, and not uncomfortably. We're just both kind of free spirits. I love to work with a lot of different people, but I was also just gagging to see what I could do on my own. But I'm sure in the future, Guy and I will get back together to do another record, or to record a few songs together.""

In December 2003, Heap announced on her website that she was going to write and produce her second solo album, using her site as a blog to publicise progress.

Heap recorded a rendition of the song ""I'm a Lonely Little Petunia (In an Onion Patch)"" for the seventh episode of the fourth season of the HBO drama series Six Feet Under, which premiered in August 2004. Her rendition later appeared as the album closer for the 2005 soundtrack album Six Feet Under, Vol. 2: Everything Ends.

Heap set herself a deadline of one year to make the album, booking a session to master the album one year ahead in December 2004. She re-mortgaged her flat to fund production costs, including renting a studio at Atomic Studios, London (previously inhabited by UK grime artist, Dizzee Rascal), and purchasing instruments.

At the end of 2004, with the album completed, Heap premiered two album tracks online, selling them prior to the album's release – ""Just for Now"" and ""Goodnight and Go"".

In May 2005, Heap released the lead single from her forthcoming album, ""Hide and Seek"". The song earned immense popularity after being used to score the season two finale of the Fox television series The O.C. on the same day as its release. It peaked in the top-40 of the Billboard Digital Songs chart, eventually receiving a gold certification from the RIAA and going on to be sampled in the song ""Whatcha Say"" by American singer Jason Derulo, which topped the Billboard Hot 100.

Heap released the album on her own label, Megaphonic Records. The album was titled Speak for Yourself. Speak for Yourself was released in the UK on 18 July 2005 on CD and iTunes UK, where it entered the top 10 chart. The initial 10,000 physical copies pressed sold out, distributed through large and independent record stores and Heap's own online shop. In August 2005, Heap announced that she had licensed Speak for Yourself to RCA Records for the album's release in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The album was released in November 2005 and débuted at number 144 in the Billboard Top 200 album chart. In concert, Heap performed solo, controlling the sound through her laptop, as well as singing and playing the piano and array mbira. Also that month, Heap appeared on the soundtrack for the 2005 romantic comedy film Just Like Heaven, performing a cover of the song ""Spooky"" by American band Classics IV. Heap announced, upon her return to the UK, that she had signed a deal for the album to be released internationally, as well as re-promoted in the UK, with a new imprint of Sony BMG, White Rabbit, run by former Sony BMG UK A&R vice president Nick Raphael.

In November 2005, Heap wrote and recorded the song ""Can't Take It In"" for the soundtrack of the fantasy film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, which was released one month later.

Speak for Yourself was re-released on the label on 24 April 2006, ahead of a full promotional push on 15 May, a week after the second single, ""Goodnight and Go"", was commercially released in the UK. Heap recorded an a cappella cover of the Leonard Cohen song ""Hallelujah"" for the season three finale of The O.C., which premiered in May 2006.

Heap wrote and performed the song ""Glittering Cloud"", which was based on the plague of locusts, as part of an event called the Margate Exodus sponsored by Artangel in November 2006, where ten artists each performed one song based on one of the Plagues of Egypt in Margate. The songs were compiled in the 2006 album Plague Songs.

In late September and early October, Heap embarked on a tour of the UK, holding a competition on MySpace for different support acts for each venue before touring throughout Canada and the US in November and December. This was her first tour of North America that included a band, incorporating upright bass, percussion, and support acts Kid Beyond and Levi Weaver on beatbox and guitar, respectively. In December 2006, Heap was featured on the front page of The Green Room magazine.

On 7 December 2006, Heap received two Grammy nominations for the 49th Annual Grammy Awards, one for Best New Artist and the other for Best Song Written For Motion Picture, Television Or Other Visual Media for ""Can't Take It In"".

Throughout the creation of her album Ellipse, Heap posted vlogs, or VBlogs as she called them, on YouTube. She used these to comment on the album as well as update on its release. The album's release was pushed back multiple times. These included Heap being asked to perform at the annual event PopTech in October 2008. During the event, she premiered one of her album's songs, ""Wait it Out"".

In October 2008, Heap gave a musical performance in the anti-human trafficking documentary and rockumentary film Call + Response, directed by Justin Dillon. She was also featured on two songs on Jeff Beck's live album Live at Ronnie Scott's and appeared in the accompanying DVD in April 2009.

Her participation in 1989 led her to become part of the production team that won Album of the Year at the 58th Grammy Awards. She was one of the artists featured in an episode of the 2016 PBS docuseries Soundbreaking and she narrated and composed music for the 2016 documentary Crossing Bhutan, which premiered at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. Also in 2016, she was commissioned by French advertising agency BETC and British company Cow & Gate, in collaboration with researchers from Goldsmiths, University of London, to help write a song which would be proven to ""make babies happy"", which was eventually titled ""The Happy Song"". The track was engineered through several months of scientific testing and was released in October 2016.

Heap wrote, produced and performed the song ""Magic Me"" as the score for the 2017 animated short film Escape, which premiered at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival in April of that year. Heap also performed ""The Quiet"" as the end credits song for the 2017 Square Enix video game The Quiet Man.

She released the single ""Last Night of an Empire"" in December 2020.After touring for nearly two years straight for her album Speak for Yourself, Heap continued her travels, this time with only a laptop and video camera on hand as she began her writing trip for her next album. Nine weeks later she returned to the UK with the beginnings of the award-winning Ellipse and footage (as requested by a fan to film the making of the album) from its quiet beginning. Back in Essex, Heap hired Justine Pearsall to document the creation of the album. The film documents the creation of the album and the renovation of Heap's childhood home, including turning her old playroom into her new home studio. Everything In-Between: The Story of Ellipse was released in November 2010.

On 5 November 2010 at the Royal Albert Hall, Heap conducted an orchestra including her friends and family as they performed an original piece composed by Heap and orchestrated by Andrew Skeet. Heap also worked with London Contemporary Voices at this time, a scratch choir formed for this concert, which continues as a new choir in its own right. It was the score to the concept film Love The Earth, for which fans were invited to submit video footage highlighting all the qualities of nature to be selected and edited into a film. This performance was broadcast live worldwide.

Heap performed in the Film and Music Arena at Latitude Festival in 2011.

In 2014, filmmaker Christopher Ian Smith made Cumulus, an experimental documentary exploring key elements of Heap's background, personality and music practice.

Ella Henderson,"Gabriella Michelle Henderson was born in Tetney, Lincolnshire on 12 January 1996, to a Scottish father, Sean, and an English mother of Swedish ancestry, Michelle. She has two brothers named Patrick and Fraser, and a sister named Holly.

Henderson began singing around the age of three and taught herself to play the piano a few years later. She began to put on shows for her family at Christmas and developed a special bond with her grandfather Bill, who encouraged her to pursue her love of music and songwriting. Her interest developed further at primary school, St Martins Prep School in Grimsby, and she subsequently decided to audition for a scholarship place at Tring Park School for the Performing Arts in Hertfordshire.

Henderson succeeded in gaining a scholarship and boarded at the school from the age of 11 to 16. She attended the school at the same time as Dan Ferrari-Lane of boyband District3, who was on The X Factor with Henderson in 2012. In early 2012, Henderson made a singing appearance on a celebrity Christmas special of Channel 4's Come Dine with Me, where she performed ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"".","In 2012, Henderson auditioned for series nine of The X Factor with the original song called ""Missed"", which was later included on her debut studio album. She reached the live shows and was mentored by Tulisa. Henderson and James Arthur were controversially in the bottom two in week seven and sang for survival. Tulisa and Louis Walsh voted to send Henderson through to the quarter-final and Nicole Scherzinger and Gary Barlow voted to send Arthur through to the quarter-final. The result went to deadlock and Arthur advanced to the quarter-final receiving 13.7% of the vote and Henderson received 12.1%. She consequently finished in sixth place, despite being a strong favourite to win. Presenter Dermot O'Leary described Henderson's exit as ""one of the biggest shocks we've ever had on the results show.""

During the show and following her exit, a number of celebrities came out in support and praise of Henderson, including Adele, Chloë Grace Moretz, Simon Cowell, Sarah Millican, Stephen Fry, Lily Allen, Nick Grimshaw and Cher. In 2013, on The Xtra Factor, O'Leary named Henderson the most talented performer in his seven years on the show, in his view.First audition—Free choice—""Missed""—Ella Henderson—Through to Bootcamp,Second audition—Free choice—""Midnight Train to Georgia""—Gladys Knight & the Pips—Through to Bootcamp,Bootcamp—Solo performance—""Believe""—Cher—Through to Judges' houses,Judges' houses—Free choice—""I Won't Give Up""—Jason Mraz—Through to Live show,Live show 1—Heroes—""Rule the World""—Take That—Safe (3rd),Live show 2—Love and heartbreak—""Loving You""—Minnie Riperton—Safe (4th),Live show 3—Club classics—""You Got the Love""—Candi Staton—Safe (3rd),Live show 4—Halloween—""Bring Me to Life""—Evanescence—Safe (6th),Live show 5—Number Ones—""Firework""—Katy Perry—Safe (5th),Live show 6—Best of British—""Written in the Stars""—Tinie Tempah—Safe (4th),Live show 7—Guilty pleasures—""You're the One That I Want""—Grease—Bottom two (6th),Live show 7—Final showdown—""If You're Not the One""—Daniel Bedingfield—Eliminated,In December 2012, Henderson made an appearance on Ireland's RTÉ The Saturday Night Show, singing ""Silent Night"". While being interviewed on the show, she revealed that she had signed a record deal with Sony Music Entertainment. She also performed ""Last Christmas"" and ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" on the Myleene Klass Heart FM show that month. In January 2013, Henderson confirmed she had signed to Simon Cowell's record label Syco Music. During January and February 2013, she took part in The X Factor live tour, where she sang four songs: her X Factor audition song ""Missed"", ""Believe"", ""Rule the World"" and ""You Got the Love"". She also performed ""Believe"" at the 18th National Television Awards in January, and appeared as a special guest at the Capital Summertime Ball in June, where she performed a duet of ""Beneath Your Beautiful"" with Labrinth.

Henderson's debut single, ""Ghost"", co-written with Ryan Tedder, was released on 8 June 2014. It debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, and remained in the top five of the chart for eight consecutive weeks. It has subsequently been certified platinum for sales in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The song later ranked at number 84 on the Official Charts Company list of the 100 biggest songs of the 2010s in the UK. Its follow-up, ""Glow"", was released on 5 October 2014 and charted at number seven in the UK. Henderson's debut studio album, Chapter One, was released on 13 October 2014. It was written by Henderson in collaboration with a number of writers and producers including Claude Kelly, Salaam Remi, Babyface and TMS. The album peaked at number one on the UK Albums Chart, and was the 19th and 31st best-selling album in the UK in 2014 and 2015, respectively. It was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). The album also charted in the top 20 in Australia, Austria, Denmark, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, and the United States. Its third and fourth singles, ""Yours"" and ""Mirror Man"", were released on 30 November 2014 and 9 March 2015, respectively. The former charted at number 16 in the UK.

Henderson performed as the supporting act for Take That on their 38 date Take That Live 2015 UK tour, while embarking on her debut headlining UK tour in October and November 2015. That July, she featured on drum and bass duo Sigma's single ""Glitterball"", which peaked at number four in the UK.

In April 2017, it was announced that she would be supporting James Arthur on his Back from the Edge Tour. In June, she featured along with other artists, including fellow X Factor artists Leona Lewis, Louis Tomlinson, Liam Payne, James Arthur, Louisa Johnson and Matt Terry on a cover version of Simon & Garfunkel's song ""Bridge over Troubled Water"", which was recorded to raise money for those affected by the Grenfell Tower fire in London earlier that month. The single reached number one in the UK after only two days sales. Later that year, it was announced that Arthur had recorded a duet with Henderson, reportedly set to be included on her second studio album. While supporting him on his tour, she performed new songs that were set to be included on the record: ""Ugly"", ""Cry Like a Woman"", ""Bones"", ""Solid Gold"" and ""Let's Go Home Together"", her duet with Arthur.

In February 2018, it was announced that Henderson and Syco Music had parted ways. In a statement, a Syco representative stated: ""Syco and Ella Henderson are parting company. We wish Ella all the best for the future and thank her for her hugely successful contribution over the years."" In May 2018, Henderson confirmed that she had completed work on her second studio album. Later that year, she signed a record deal with Asylum Records' imprint Major Toms operated by the British group Rudimental, and was working on new material with them, presumably meaning that the previously confirmed album was scrapped. She also supported Rudimental on their European tour that year. Regarding the scrapped material, Henderson later told i: ""I did write an album – well, I say an album, I wrote a body of work. But I was so lost in terms of who I was as a person that I wasn't ready to release it. I knew that if I didn't know what was going on, my fans wouldn't either.""

In July, she provided uncredited vocals for a UK top five single she had co-written titled ""Lighter"" by British DJ and producer Nathan Dawe, featuring British YouTuber and rapper KSI. Henderson released the single ""Dream On Me"" with Roger Sanchez on 2 October 2020, and a Christmas song ""Blame It on the Mistletoe"" with AJ Mitchell on 4 December.

On 19 February 2021, she released her collaboration with Tom Grennan titled ""Let's Go Home Together"", which debuted at number 28 in the UK and peaked at 10 becoming Henderson's fifth UK top 10 single. The song was originally a duet between Henderson and James Arthur, and they performed it together live on Arthur's 2017 arena tour, but due to a scheduling conflict Henderson recorded its single version with Grennan instead.

On 20 August 2021, Henderson released the single titled ""Risk It All"" with House Gospel Choir and Just Kiddin. The following month, she collaborated with the French DJ duo Ofenbach on the single ""Hurricane"".","

They then began street performing, making and selling jewelry and clothing around Europe, and consequently, she never attended school. By the age of four, Hitch was travelling and performing with the Archaos circus. At age of ten, she began writing poetry which led to her writing lyrics. Her boyfriend noticed that she could sing and encouraged her to hone her singing. By the time she was in her teens, Hitch was trained as a trapeze artist, fire swinger and stilt walker and had performed across Europe. Her family was featured in a BBC documentary.

Sanna-June Hyde,"Hyde was born in Colchester in 1976, the daughter of a Finnish mother and English father.","Hyde studied in London at Drama Studio London and East 15 Acting School. She continued her singing work by taking singing lessons in jazz and 1940s popular cabaret standards. Early in her career, she was noted as the mysterious female vocalist on the rock band HIM's song ""Dark Sekret Love"" from their EP 666 Ways to Love: Prologue and their cover of ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"" from their debut album Greatest Love Songs Vol. 666.

Hyde's early theatre work started in 2001, when she moved to her mother's native Finland after receiving an offer from the Joensuu City Theatre. She later worked in the city theatres of Joensuu, Helsinki, and Espoo. Since 2005, she has been performing regularly at Helsinki City Theatre. Her work there includes the role of Marcelle Paillardin, object of Master Builder Pinglet's desires, in Hotelli Paradiso by Georges Feydeau. She was also in Metsäperkele, written and directed by Kari Heiskanen, based on the Finnish 19th century industrialist G.A. Serlachius.

The drama film Pihalla (known as Playground in Germany), in which Hyde plays Riina, was released in 2009. She was picked out, along with Mikko Leppilampi, by critic Helsingin Sanomat for special praise; however, the film itself received mainly poor reviews. The political and media satire Koljatti opened on 30 September 2010 at Helsinki City Theatre, in which she played Riikka Tanner, assistant to the prime minister. Political satire in theatre was new to Finland at the time, and the production was somewhat groundbreaking in the deferential Finnish political climate. The play was immediately heavily criticised by the leading Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat.

In 2010, Hyde was also in the popular Arsenikkia ja vanhoja pitsejä (Arsenic and Old Lace) as the sole female in the cast, as the two female roles were played by men. Her third production currently running was the comedy for children ""Risto Räppääjä"". Both plays can be categorised as family entertainments.

Bain settled on the stage name The Japanese House because she did not feel ready to reveal her name or gender. As a result, very little was known about The Japanese House when her debut single ""Still"" was premiered on BBC Radio 1 with Zane Lowe on 2 March 2015.

Bain's androgynous voice and avoidance of press photography fuelled speculation about her gender and identity. After the release of ""Still"", there was widespread speculation that the singer behind The Japanese House was a man, and some fans even speculated that it was a side project of Healy's. Bain went on her first tour as an opening act for The 1975 in 2015. Bain subsequently released three more singles. ""Pools to Bathe In"" was released on 25 March 2015, ""Teeth"" on 8 April 2015, and ""Sister"" on 21 April 2015. Bain's first EP Pools to Bathe In, a compilation of her four previous singles, was released on 27 April 2015 to favourable reviews.

The titular single from the EP Clean was released on 7 September 2015 and premiered on BBC Radio 1 that same day. The EP's second single, ""Cool Blue"" was released 15 September, followed by ""Letter by the Water"" on 27 October 2015. The final single, ""Sugar Pill"" was released on 3 November 2015. Clean was released on 6 November 2015, and received positive reviews from critics.On 26 September 2016 Bain released ""Face Like Thunder"", the first single from her upcoming EP Swim Against the Tide. Bain stated that the EP's title was inspired by the feeling of falling in love and losing someone, saying ""[it] feels like you’re swimming against the tide. In a sense it’s a struggle"". The track received favourable reviews for its emotional subject matter and melodic beat.

Bain released Swim Against the Tide on 11 November 2016. She supported the 1975 on their 2016 North American tour to promote their second album, I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It. The Japanese House headlined a North American tour beginning on 21 February 2017 and ending on 28 March.

On 26 April 2017 Bain released the single ""Saw You in a Dream"". The single was noted for using fewer layered tracks, and having a starker, less production heavy sound than many of Bain's previous songs. The full EP Saw You in a Dream was originally scheduled for release on 16 June 2017 but was released on 30 June. The EP was praised for showcasing the evolution of Bain's dreamy style, with strong vocals and a more reserved use of production effects.Bain released the single ""Lilo"" on 27 September 2018. After the release of ""Lilo"", The Japanese House announced a North American tour in December 2019. On 12 November 2018 Bain released ""Follow My Girl"", the album's second single. That same day, Billboard announced that The Japanese House's debut album Good at Falling was to be released on 1 March 2019. The album was co-produced with George Daniel (of the 1975) and BJ Burton.

Upon its release, Good at Falling received mostly positive reviews. Megan Buerger of Pitchfork called it ""confident and intoxicating"", although she commented that its melancholic lyrical content almost exasperated her at points. Bain announced her second Good at Falling tour in the US for October and November 2019.

Bain released the EP The LA Sessions on 8 August 2019. The LA Sessions featured re-imagined tracks from Good at Falling and Saw You in a Dream which were recorded live in Los Angeles. On 27 September 2019, Bain released a single titled ""Something Has to Change"", and announced an upcoming extended play of the same name. The EP was announced to be released in November 2019, but was delayed into early 2020. On 22 November 2019, she released a single titled ""Chewing Cotton Wool."" On 10 August 2020, Bain announced that the EP, now titled Chewing Cotton Wool, was to be released on 12 August 2020. Bain released the EP on 12 August 2020. It featured four songs, one of which was a collaboration with Justin Vernon of indie folk band Bon Iver, as well as the previously released singles. Upon its release, Chewing Cotton Wool received praise for showing further growth of Bain's signature lush, hazy production, introducing more textured and sporadic electronics.","Title—Details—Peak chart positions,Title—Details—Good at Falling—* Released: 1 March 2019 * Label: Dirty Hit * Formats: CD, LP, digital download, cassette—64,Pools to Bathe In—* Released: 27 April 2015 * Label: Dirty Hit * Formats: 12"", digital download,Clean—* Released: 6 November 2015 * Label: Dirty Hit * Formats: 12"", digital download,Swim Against the Tide—* Released: 11 November 2016 * Label: Dirty Hit * Formats: 12"", digital download,Saw You in a Dream—* Released: 30 June 2017 * Label: Dirty Hit * Formats: 12"", digital download,Spotify Singles—* Released: 26 July 2017 * Label: Dirty Hit * Format: Streaming,The LA Sessions—* Released: 8 August 2019 * Label: Dirty Hit * Format: Digital download,Chewing Cotton Wool—* Released: 12 August 2020 * Label: Dirty Hit * Formats: 12"", Digital download,""Still""—2015—Pools to Bathe In,""Clean""—2015—Pools to Bathe In—Clean,""Face Like Thunder""—2015—Pools to Bathe In—Clean—2016—Swim Against the Tide,""Saw You in a Dream""—2015—Pools to Bathe In—Clean—2016—Swim Against the Tide—2017—Saw You in a Dream,""Lilo""—2015—2018—Clean—2016—Swim Against the Tide—2017—Saw You in a Dream—Good at Falling,""Maybe You're the Reason""—2015—2018—2019—2017—Saw You in a Dream—Good at Falling,""Something Has to Change""—2015—Chewing Cotton Wool—2019—Good at Falling,""Clean""—2015—Juliet Bryant,""Cool Blue""—2015—Juliet Bryant,""Letter by the Water""—2015—Juliet Bryant,""Sugar Pill""—2015—Juliet Bryant,""Face Like Thunder""—2016—Gareth Phillips,""Saw You in a Dream""—2017—Lucy Tcherniak,""Lilo""—2018—David East,""Maybe You're the Reason""—2019—Harvey Pearson,""Something Has to Change""—2019—Nadira Amrani,",N/A,an English indie pop musician from Buckinghamshire,13/6/1995,2012–present,Dream pop · indie pop · electropop · yacht rock,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Japanese_House

Jessie J,"Jessica Ellen Cornish was born on 27 March 1988 in Chadwell Heath in The London Borough of Redbridge, London, to Rose and Stephen Cornish. She was educated at Mayfield High School in LB Redbridge. This area was part of Essex until 1965 and Jessie J refers to herself as an Essex girl. She attended Colin's Performing Arts School and as an 11-year-old she was cast in Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End production of Whistle Down the Wind. She subsequently joined the National Youth Music Theatre and appeared in their 2002 production of The Late Sleepers.

Cornish has two elder sisters, who were both head girls at school. Unlike her academic sisters, Cornish has stated she was ""never really that good at anything"". She said, ""At school they were like 'oh, you're a Cornish girl' and they kind of expected me to be the same as my sisters. Give me something to draw or an outfit to pick for someone, or hair, make-up, acting, write a song, I'm fine with it, but anything to do with sums – it was never my thing."" She also said she never based her intelligence on her exam results. She also said she was always good at singing and it was her ""thing"". In 2003, at age 15, she won Best Pop Singer in the TV show Britain's Brilliant Prodigies, performing as Jessica Cornish. At the age of 16 she began studying at the BRIT School and at 17 she joined a girl group named Soul Deep. She graduated in the class of 2006 along with singers Adele and Leona Lewis. She claims she suffered a 'minor stroke at 18.'","Jessie J was signed to Gut Records, recording an album for the label, but the company went bankrupt before any material was released. She then found success as a songwriter, gaining a Sony ATV publishing contract. She was also the support act for Cyndi Lauper during Lauper's UK dates of her 2008 Bring Ya to the Brink tour (Lauper invited J to join her on stage for the performances of ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun""). Jessie has also written lyrics for artists such as Chris Brown and Miley Cyrus, including ""Party in the U.S.A."". Jessie J was also part of a girl band, called Soul Deep, for two years, however, believing ""it wasn't going anywhere,"" she left the group. Despite people thinking that her first notoriety was through YouTube, Jessie was signed for four years before her first video was posted. Jessie first came to the attention of Lava Records when her publisher at Sony/ATV, Rich Christina, sent Lava president Jason Flom a link to her MySpace page, which the record executive loved. After seeing an impressive US showcase, Lava, along with several other labels, was keen to sign the artist but progress was hampered by her management's insistence on, what Flom called, a ""crazy deal"", and their refusal to let Jessie speak to any labels directly. Despite this, Senior Director of A&R at Lava, Harinder Rana, made surreptitious efforts to meet Jessie on her own in winter of 2008. Later in the year a change in management to Sarah Stennett and Nadia Khan of Crown Music allowed record deal negotiations to take place. Jessie eventually signed with Lava as part of a joint venture with Universal Republic.Jessie J began recording her debut studio album in 2005 and it was completed on 19 January 2011. She revealed that ""Big White Room"" would be on the album and was written from an experience she had when she was aged 11, although she wrote the song at age 17, in the hospital, where a ward mate, a little boy, died. Jessie J says the album's title track, ""Who You Are"", is one of her proudest creations, she said the song is a ""positive role model for young people"" and ""I always say that I'm half-artist, half-therapist"". The song was written in 2005, when she just moved to Los Angeles, and was going through a very lonely difficult moment. A song called ""Sexy Silk"", which appears on the Easy A soundtrack, was originally going to be her first single. However, in late 2010 Jessie J released her first single, ""Do It Like a Dude"" which was co-written with George Astasio, Tj Normandin, Jason Pebworth, Jon Shave, Kyle Abrahams and Peter Ighile. Originally, she wrote the song with Rihanna in mind because ""Rude Boy"" was released at the time, partly inspiring the song. She then sent the song to her label, Island Records, before sending it to Rihanna's management. Island insisted the song become Jessie J's first single. The single gained positive reception from critics. The single charted at number two on the UK Singles Chart. Her follow-up single ""Price Tag"" was released in late January 2011. It was written by Jessie J, Dr. Luke, Claude Kelly, and B.o.B and peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart. ""Price Tag"" was released in the US on 1 February 2011 and peaked at 23 on the Billboard Hot 100. ""Price Tag"" also charted at number-one in New Zealand and Ireland and is the most successful online video J has released. Her first American television appearance was as the musical guest on NBC's Saturday Night Live on 12 March 2011.



On 25 February 2011 her debut album, Who You Are, was released. The album first entered the UK Albums Chart on 6 March 2011 where it charted at number two.

On 12 June 2011, at the Summertime Ball held at Wembley Stadium, London, Jessie ruptured several tendons in her foot during rehearsals, and performed her set the following day while sitting on a gilded throne. For her appearance at Glastonbury Festival 2011 on 25 June 2011, she performed on the throne again, stating that her doctor had told her not to perform with her broken foot which would take six weeks to heal. Jessie J was scheduled to play at several festivals throughout the summer, however it was reported on 1 July 2011 that she would not be able to attend T in the Park, T4 on the Beach, Wembley:Orange, iTunes Festival, Lovebox, and Oxegen due to the injuries to her foot. Her record label released an official statement on 30 June 2011 that under strict orders from her doctor, she would not be able to perform for a number of weeks so that she could recuperate properly. She returned to the concert circuit in late August, including sets at the V Festival and The Big Chill. At the 2011 MTV VMA's she was still in a cast and using the throne.

Christina Johnston,"When Johnston was four, she and her mother Gillian were involved in a car crash while heading for Amberfield School, near Ipswich. Johnston can still recall her mother being cut out of the automobile and resuscitated in the ambulance on the way to hospital, where her injuries kept her for five months. Johnston herself spent three weeks in the same hospital with a broken left leg and numerous cuts on her head, and returned for further surgery six months later.

During this time, Johnston became close to her father, Peter, who taught her piano and guitar and had her sing harmony with him as he played. However, he died unexpectedly when she was eleven.

Shakila Karim,"Karim was born at the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel, Tower Hamlets, London, England  and is of Bangladeshi descent. Karim's parents are Karim Ullah (born 1977) and Sultana Parvin, and she has a younger sister, Sonia.

Karim attended Gatehouse School in Bethnal Green. She received speech therapy to help her speak. Yet she was able to sing nursery rhymes perfectly. At around the same time, she started playing her first musical instrument, the violin, when she was a toddler and went on to learn the recorder, piano, ukulele and drums. When she was 11 years old, Karim's family moved out of the East End to Hertfordshire and she started her secondary education at Hockerill Anglo-European College in Bishop's Stortford. She started taking singing lessons from the first term and, in her first year at the school, she passed her Rock School grade three exam. She then attended school in Newport, Essex near Carver Barracks, and then Newport Free Grammar School in Uttlesford. As of 2015, she was studying A-levels at Joyce Frankland Academy in Newport. After completing her A-levels in 2016 Karim enrolled at The ICMP (The Institute of Contemporary Music Performance) to study Creative Musicianship where she is a final year student.","During the 2010 summer holidays, Karim uploaded her first videos on YouTube, started performing at local venues, entered the 2011 Stortford Music Festival, and auditioned for Britain's Got Talent at the age of 12.

In 2011, Karim released three self-produced singles. On 4 July, Karim's debut single ""Just Let It Go"" was released. On 24 October, her second single ""Gone Too Soon"" was released.

In August of the same year, she performed at the Hertford Music Festival. In August 2014, she performed at the second annual Warren Classic.

In October 2013, Karim performed at Wembley Stadium as part of the 92Plus1 challenge to raise money for Help for Heroes. She sang before England's World Cup qualifier against Poland.

In June 2015, Karim began a musical 'marathon' to sing at 26 different concerts to raise money for the victims of Nepal's earthquake, after being inspired by some of her schoolfriends at Joyce Frankland Academy who are from Nepal. In August of the same year, she performed live on BBC Asian Network.

During the summer of 2017, Karim and her father organised a special concert for ICMP students to raise money for the survivors of Grenfell Tower.

Trish Keenan,"Patricia Anne Keenan was born in Winson Green, a multicultural inner-city area in west Birmingham, England. She had two brothers, Malcolm and John, and two sisters, Maxine and Barbara. She was raised by her mother Zena, who was a prostitute: ""I have got no problem with people knowing me or any personal details about myself,"" Keenan commented. ""I have had a crazy life: I was brought up by a prostitute.""

Keenan attended Archbishop Grimshaw Roman Catholic school, presently known as John Henry Newman Catholic school. She worked a range of catering jobs after school until at the age of 21 when she moved to Moseley, a bohemian enclave. She studied Creative Writing at Birmingham University while working on her music career.","Soon after moving to Moseley, Keenan formed a musical duo called Hayward Winters, and subsequently met James Cargill at a 1960s psychedelic revival club. The two of them formed a relationship over their shared interest and formed a folk band, Pan Am Flight Bag. The band was short-lived only performing two gigs before they reformed in 1996 as Broadcast, which included guitarist Tim Felton, drummer Steve Perkins, and keyboardist Roj Stevens.

With Broadcast, Keenan released a total of five studio albums, including The Noise Made by People (2000), Haha Sound (2003), and Tender Buttons (2005);  Keenan wrote the latter while her father was dying of cancer. In 2009 the group released a collaborative album Broadcast and The Focus Group Investigate Witch Cults of the Radio Age, with The Focus Group, the music project of graphic designer Julian House (who also designed all of Broadcast's album sleeves).

Keenan lived in and near Birmingham throughout her life, and her music career was based there. In an interview with Billboard, she said: ""There's really a down tone in Birmingham. People here definitely underplay themselves. There's definitely a lack of confidence, and almost a resignation and defeatism among musicians here.""","

The first track of the album, Queen of Waters, was nominated for the ""Best Original Song"" category at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards in 2011.

Kerr has also worked with a number of groups, including folk/pop group Epona, Australian folk family band The Fagans and the Tim van Eyken band. In 2010 she joined James Fagan, Richard Arrowsmith and Jess Arrowsmith to form Melrose Quartet in her new home city of Sheffield. They released a live EP in 2011 called Live at Cheltenham and two studio albums: Fifty Verses in 2013 and Dominion in 2017. She has also performed in the trio Simpson Cutting Kerr, with Martin Simpson and Andy Cutting, whose debut CD Murmurs was released on Topic Records on 8 June 2015.

Kerr has been involved in several commissioned works. In 2013 she was part of Fay Hield's The Full English band to promote the on-line publication of the folk collections of the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library in Cecil Sharp House. The collective won ""Best Group"" at the 2014 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards and their CD The Full English won ""Best Album"" at the same ceremony. In 2014 Kerr was a key songwriter in The Elizabethan Session, a concert, CD and film commissioned by Folk by the Oak and The English Folk Dance and Song Society creating new music about the Elizabethan era. In November 2015, Kerr was one of four songwriters commissioned by Folk by the Oak and The English Folk Dance and Song Society to write and tour a production called Sweet Liberties looking at the history of British parliament and democracy. Their CD Sweet Liberties was released in 2016. In 2017 and 2018 Kerr was one of five musicians who formed Shake the Chains, a project that explored ""the role songs have played in social change, resistance and protest"". The project was commissioned by Folk by the Oak and supported by Arts Council England, Help Musicians and Folk Alliance. The group toured in 2017 and 2018, and made a live album in 2017.

In 2014, Kerr released Sweet Visitor, her first CD of original songs under her own name, on her own label Little Dish Records. The album's release on 21 July 2014 was followed by a UK tour with The Sweet Visitor Band (James Fagan, Rowan Rheingans, Tom Wright and Tim Yates) in November. James Fagan now shares his role in the band with Greg Russell. 2016 saw the production of Kerr's second album of original songs with The Sweet Visitor Band on Little Dish Records. The album, entitled Instar, was produced by Tom Wright and was released on 16 September 2016.

In 2017 and 2018, Kerr played the Mother in a production of Peter Bellamy's folk opera The Transports.

Having previously taught on the Newcastle University Folk Degree, Kerr is now a Principal Lecturer and Voice & Fiddle Tutor at Leeds College of Music.

Myleene Klass,"Klass has been an amateur astronomer for most of her life, having been taught the basics by her father. She was one of a handful of celebrities, engineers and scientists who were at the UK National Space Centre control centre for the touchdown of the UK Mars probe Beagle 2 in the early morning of Christmas Day 2003. Since then, she has been a keen supporter of the UK's work in the European space programme. In March 2006, Klass publicly criticised the proposed closure of the London Planetarium and explained on television how to view Venus in the early morning. She also appeared on Channel 4's Richard & Judy to discuss the book Moondust, which follows the lives of the first men on the moon, and in 2007 attended the televised party on BBC One, held at the home of Patrick Moore in Selsey to mark the 50th anniversary of Moore's monthly programme, The Sky at Night. Klass once studied astronomy with the Open University.

In December 2005, Klass was attacked by a group of teenagers in a newsagent in Bermondsey. She had a bag of chips dropped on her head and was pushed to the ground. The teenagers attempted to take photos of Klass on their mobile phones.

In May 2006, Klass was involved in a go-karting crash at a charity race in Cardiff, South Wales, sustaining an injury to her leg.

On 1 April 2007, she announced she was expecting her first child on 7 September. As a result, she delayed her wedding to Graham Quinn until 2008. Their daughter Ava was born on 16 August 2007. Klass's spokesman said, ""Myleene presented The One Show and felt a bit weird on the way home. She went to the hospital to get checked out and they told her she was in labour."" Klass published a book about her experiences of being pregnant, entitled My Bump and Me: From Morning Sickness to Motherhood – An Honest Diary of My Pregnancy. She gave birth to a second daughter on 25 March 2011, called Hero.

In May 2009, Klass had an accumulated wealth of £7.5 million.

In January 2010, Klass claimed she received a warning from Hertfordshire Police for brandishing a kitchen knife (through a window) at a group of teenagers who entered her garden while she and her daughter were alone in the house. She said that she was ""utterly terrified"" and ""aghast"" at the response by the police. Hertfordshire Police denied making any such warning and stated that the law allows householders the proportionate use of force to protect themselves. It has subsequently been reported that it was Klass's agent or publicist who notified the police of the incident and who then passed on the story to The Sun's.

On 21 October 2011, Klass and Quinn married, with 16 people in attendance. On 23 April 2013, she was granted a divorce from Quinn.

On 1 August 2019, she gave birth to her third child, a boy named Apollo. This was Klass's first child with her partner Simon Motson, who also has two children from a previous relationship. On 13 September 2020, Klass announced that she had become engaged to Motson.","In 2001, Klass auditioned for the ITV reality show Popstars, which offered contestants an opportunity to become part of a newly formed pop band. Klass was chosen as one of the ten finalists and became a member of Hear'Say, with Kym Marsh, Suzanne Shaw, Danny Foster and Noel Sullivan. Following the success of their first album, the band was given its own TV show entitled Hear'Say It's Saturday. During the show's run, the band had a chance to perform with such established artists as Lionel Richie, Celine Dion, Bradley Walsh, Blue and Atomic Kitten. At the end of 2001, Hear'Say appeared on the Royal Variety Performance.

Subsequently, the group achieved a 37-date sold-out arena tour and performed numerous television guest appearances. Klass made many appearances with Hear'Say on TV and in live performances during 2002. The pop act's many promotional appearances during the year were also broadcast as part of their own TV shows, entitled Hear'Say: A New Chapter in Full and The Hear'Say Story. In total, Hear'Say had four Top 10 singles including two number-ones in the British charts, before splitting up after a reported long-term feud between Klass and Marsh. The feud resulted in Marsh leaving the band in December 2001, to be replaced by Johnny Shentall in 2002. The band split up in October of that year.On 13 May 2003, Klass signed a five-album deal with Classics and Jazz. Promotion started with the release of the main promotional single ""Toccata and Fugue"" to TV channels and was the first ever classical piece to appear on the British music television channel The Box. She also appeared in the video for ""Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?"" with The Girls of FHM, which went to No. 10 in the UK Singles Chart.

Klass's album, Moving On, was launched on 20 October 2003 at Harrods, London. The album included reworked versions of popular classical pieces such as Fauré's Pavane, Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata and Satie's Gymnopedie No.2. Moving On also included music from the Oscar-winning films Gladiator and The Piano. New arrangements for piano of more contemporary works were also included on the album, namely Linkin Park's ""Crawling"" and Daniel Bedingfield's ""If You're Not the One"". In its first week of release. Moving On peaked at No. 2 in the UK Classical Chart, behind Hayley Westenra. It peaked at No. 32 in the UK Albums Chart. By mid-December 2003, the album had been certified gold. In April 2004, Moving On was nominated as Album of the Year in the Classical BRIT Awards. The award went to Bryn Terfel's platinum-selling record Bryn. Klass confirmed there would be a re-release of the album with five new tracks, but its release was pushed back because of conflicts between Klass's new management company (Mel Bush Organisation) and her previous (Safe Management) regarding royalties. Ultimately, the release was cancelled, the only remnant being the Asian release of Moving On, which includes three new tracks: ""Trouble"" (a Coldplay cover version with Klass's vocals), ""Sahara"" and ""Le Onde"". Klass then said that she would be working on a new album which would include a number of tracks with her vocals. However, on 23 October 2004, it was announced that Klass would not be releasing any further material through her label UCJ, Universal Classics and Jazz.

On 28 March 2007, Klass signed a record contract with EMI Classics as both a recording artist and an ambassador for the EMI Classics UK roster of artists. These include Alfie Boe, Natasha Marsh and Natalie Clein. The deal included the release of a series of albums on which Klass performed two exclusive tracks and chose a number of her favourite classical pieces from the EMI Classics back catalogue. The first album, Myleene's Music for Romance, was released on 2 July 2007 and went straight to number 1 in the classical chart. A music video to accompany the lead track, ""Cinema Paradiso"", was shot at the Bucharest Opera House in Romania in April.

Klass's second album in the EMI series, Myleene's Music for Mothers, was released on 18 February 2008, and has two tracks played by Klass. These two tracks are the popular ""America"" from West Side Story, written by Leonard Bernstein, and Ennio Morricone's ""Chi Mai"", known best as the theme to the 1981 BBC TV drama serial The Life and Times of Lloyd George. In March 2013, she helped to celebrate Andrew Lloyd Webber's 40-year work with her rendition of ""Shakalaka- Baby"" from the musical Bombay Dreams.","

Sonja Kristina,"According to AllMusic, it was Galt McDermott, who wrote the music for Hair and another musical Who the Murderer Was, who employed the four members of Curved Air as a house band, who suggested when the stage show closed that they add Kristina to the line-up. Another version has it that manager Mark Hanau had the idea Kristina's alto vocals could become a vital ingredient in a new band. On 1 January 1970, the singer received an official invitation to become a member of Curved Air. She remembered sitting backstage on the theatre stairs listening to a cassette of the band's music Hanau had given her, and being much impressed. Described by Sting as a ""real beauty, otherworldly and unattainable"", Kristina played a full creative role bringing with it a powerful female sexuality. Her experiences working as a croupier in the London Playboy Club during the early 1970s, reflected itself in the stage persona she later developed.

Curved Air had a changing line-up over their nine albums (1970–1976 and 1990), with Kristina being the only constant element. Since 2008, she has taken part in a series of Curved Air reunion concerts. She was romantically involved with Curved Air drummer Stewart Copeland, they were married from 1982 to 1991.

After Curved Air, she returned to Hair. She has also performed solo, including as part of the acid folk movement in London in the early 1990s, culminating in her critically acclaimed Songs from the Acid Folk in 1991, and in a multi-media duo MASK, with Marvin Ayres.

In 2008, Curved Air was reformed with other original members including Darryl Way and Florian Pilkington-Miksa and, later, Kirby Gregory from the Air Cut line up. The band continues to record and perform internationally. ''Sonja Kristina has arrived on stage. Suddenly there is no band, no stage, no college kids. Just Sonja glinting in the green light. She moves like smoke across the stage, hardly seeming to move at all, but underdulating in slow motion. Who cares what the band is doing? As a muso I've never bothered with singers, considering them to be musical passengers/ How wrong I've been! She's not even singing yet, and she owns everything.''

– Stewart CopelandIncluding the London version of the musical Hair (1968), Kristina has performed in numerous theatre and musical theatre productions from the early 1960s onwards, including East Lynne (1966), a lead role in Romeo and Juliet, The French Have a Song For It (1979) with Helen Shapiro, Man to Woman with Marsha Hunt (1982), and Shona

Lady Sovereign,"In a 2010 interview with Diva magazine, Lady Sovereign said she came out as a lesbian in the house during Celebrity Big Brother but that her declaration did not end up in the broadcast show.

Lady Sovereign has not released any music since 2009. She has alluded to medical issues halting her career, but has never clarified an exact illness.","""The Battle"" began a string of singles that would push Lady Sovereign into the spotlight. While ""A Little Bit of Shhh!"", ""9 to 5"", and ""Sad Arse Stripah"" were selling well, free Internet-only freestyles like ""Tango"" and ""Cheeky"" were becoming just as popular. On 15 November 2005, Chocolate Industries released the Vertically Challenged EP, which collected most of her singles recorded to date. In April 2006 she released her second EP, Blah Blah in the UK. She released yet another EP, but was limited for US radios; Size Don't Matter! Aside from her own records, 2005 saw Lady Sovereign appear as a guest or contributor on several projects. She began 2005 by appearing on the grime compilation Run the Road, both as a solo artist and with The Streets. When The Ordinary Boys released the single ""Boys Will Be Boys"", Lady Sovereign came back with a reply remix, featuring the music and chorus of the original, but with mostly her own vocals to the tune of ""girls will be girls"". In May 2006, she was featured on the Ordinary Boys single, ""Nine2Five"", a remixed version of her own ""9 to 5"", credited as ""The Ordinary Boys vs Lady Sovereign."" ""Nine2Five"" entered the UK top 40 singles at number 39 on downloads only, and jumped to number 6 upon availability as a CD and 7"" vinyl single during the week commencing 22 May 2005. This is her highest chart position to date.Lady Sovereign capped off 2005 by meeting with the American hip hop artist and CEO of the labels Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records, Jay-Z. This marked her foray into the American music scene. With Usher and L.A. Reid seated next to him, Jay-Z asked for one on-the-spot freestyle from Sovereign before offering her a contract with Def Jam. With the single ""Hoodie"", Lady Sovereign released her full-length debut, Public Warning, on Def Jam in 2006. Lady Sovereign is the first non-American female to ever be signed to Def Jam Record Label.

On 31 October 2006, her debut album, Public Warning, was released, featuring ""Random"", ""9 to 5"", ""Hoodie"" and single, ""Love Me or Hate Me"", which was also released on the same day. The music video for the single features Lady Sovereign mocking stereotypical ideals of femininity by satirizing popular dress and mannerisms. Some of the lyrics include ''I'm fat, I need a diet/No, in fact I'm just here lyin'/I ain't got the biggest breast-ises,/but I write all the best disses/I've got hairy armpits/But I don't walk around like this/I wear a big baggy t-shirt that hides that nasty shit.'' With the lyrics continuing in this satirical nature, Lady Sovereign continues to comment on and express her dissonance with female lifestyles in popular culture.

On 17 October 2006 ""Love Me or Hate Me"" became the first video by a British artist to reach number 1 on the United States (and original) version of MTV's Total Request Live. ""Love Me or Hate Me"" was released in the UK on 29 January 2007, with the album following on 5 February 2007.Lady Sovereign released a second album in spring 2009. She also went on tour. After a final dispute with Island Records, it was revealed on her official website that she would release the album through her independent record label, Midget Records, and that it was fully written and some songs were already recorded. She also said the album was going to be released in the United States and United Kingdom on 7 April 2009. On Monday, 8 December 2008, Lady Sovereign restated that Jigsaw would be released on 6 April 2009. She also released a free single titled ""I Got You Dancing"", making it available on her MySpace and official website. During her ""Jigsaw"" tour she teamed up with DJ Annalyze as her tour DJ.","Title—Album details—UK—AUS—AUS Urban—JPN—US,Public Warning—* Released: 31 October 2006 * Label: Island Records, Def Jam * Formats: CD, digital download—58—97—10—212—48,Jigsaw—* Released: 6 April 2009 * Label: Midget Records, EMI * Formats: CD, digital download—121—11,""—"" denotes items which were not released in that country or failed to chart.,Vertically Challenged—* Released: 15 November 2005 * Format: CD, digital download * Label: Chocolate Industries,Blah Blah—* Released: 17 April 2006 * Format: CD, digital download * Label: Chocolate Industries,Chocolate Swim—* Released: June 2006 * Format: digital download * Label: Chocolate Industries,Jig-Raw!—* Released: 2009 * Format: digital download * Label: Independent,""Random""—2005—73—Public Warning,""9 to 5""—2005—33—141—Public Warning,""Hoodie""—2005—44—Public Warning,""Nine2Five"" (vs. The Ordinary Boys)—2006—6—12—25—How to Get Everything You Ever Wanted in Ten Easy Steps,""Love Me or Hate Me""—2006—26—48—9—17—10—65—45—1—Public Warning,""Those Were the Days""—2007—101—Public Warning,""So Human""—2009—38—36—26—Jigsaw,""I Got You Dancing""—2009—38—Jigsaw,""—"" denotes items which were not released in that country or failed to chart.,""Ch Ching (Cheque 1 2)""—2004—Vertically Challenged,""A Little Bit of Shhh""—2005—Public Warning,""Blah Blah""—2006—Public Warning,",N/A,UK -based recording artist,1985,2001–2010,"Hip hop

Anya Lahiri,"Born in Golders Green, London of Indian and Finnish origin, Lahiri attended the Henrietta Barnett School in Hampstead Garden Suburb, where she excelled in languages and music. She graduated from Birkbeck, University of London with a degree in humanities and literature in 2005.","Lahiri was scouted in Covent Garden at age 14 by Select Model Management in London. She was sent on an audition for what she thought was a music video which turned out to be an audition for a musical group. At first, she was reluctant to audition but changed her mind. She performed All Saints' ""Never Ever"" and was chosen to become a part of the girl group Precious. The band was chosen by British viewers to represent the UK in the 1999 Eurovision Song Contest with their first single, ""Say It Again"", and arrived 12th. After that, they released their first album, called Precious, which yielded two Top 10 hit singles: ""Rewind"" and ""It's Gonna Be My Way"". In the summer of 2000, the band tried to enter the United States market. In November 2000, they released their last single, called ""New Beginning"", with a video clip set in an industrial warehouse with the girl band acting like tough girls. By the end of 2000, the group went under scrutiny and the members decided it was time to stop.

Following the breakup of Precious, Lahiri returned to her education, attending Birkbeck, University of London, while continuing to model. During this time, she has modelled for brands such as Asda and ASOS as well as gracing the covers of Company and More. She was one of the FHM PitGirls in 2003.In 2003, Lahiri landed her first acting role alongside Sienna Miller in Keen Eddie. Miller advised Lahiri what acting classes to take and which reputable agencies she should try to have represent her. In 2004, she appeared in the movie Tornado with Daniel Bernhardt, and in The Grooming with Jacqueline Bisset. By 2005, she finished her studies in humanities and literature and was free to pursue her interest in acting full-time.

In 2006, Lahiri moved to Los Angeles, where she focused on becoming an actress. Being an established model, Lahiri signed with Next Models and became the face of the Anna Beth's jewels new collection. That same year, she starred in I Can't Think Straight.

By 2007, Lahiri moved back to London, where she appeared in five episodes of Dream Team as Emma. Following that, she filmed Daylight Robbery and  Goal! 3: Taking on the World.

In 2009, Lahiri focused on modeling; she was signed to agencies such as Models 1 in London, Next Models in Los Angeles, and MC2 Models in Tel Aviv. She was featured in editorials for She] magazine as well as landing a campaign for Poule de Luxe. She also appeared in The Scar Crow and Life Blood.

In 2010, she made the short film The Commuter, which was filmed entirely on the Nokia N8 in HD. She had a small part in Swinging with the Finkels and played Maddie in Meet Pursuit Delange, a short film.

Angela Lansbury,"Off-screen, Lansbury has spoken throughout her life with an English accent. She holds Irish citizenship. Biographer Martin Gottfried characterized her as ""Meticulous. Cautious. Self-editing. Deliberate. It is what the British call reserved,"" adding that she was ""as concerned, as sensitive, and as sympathetic as anyone might want in a friend"". Also noting that she had ""a profound sense of privacy"", he added that she disliked attempts at flattery.

Lansbury has been married twice, first to the actor Richard Cromwell, when she was 19 and Cromwell was 35. Cromwell and Lansbury eloped and were married in a small civil ceremony on September 27, 1945. The marriage ended in divorce in 1946, but they remained friends until his death in 1960. In 1949, she married actor and producer Peter Shaw, and they remained together for 54 years until his death in 2003. She acquired a step-son, David, from Shaw's first marriage. They had two children of their own, Anthony Peter (b. 1952) and Deirdre Ann (b. 1953). While Lansbury repeatedly stated that she wanted to put her children before her career, she admitted that she often had to leave them in California for long periods when she was working elsewhere. She brought up her children to be Episcopalian, although they were not members of a congregation. She has stated that ""I believe that God is within all of us, that we are perfect, precious beings, and that we have to put our faith and trust in that.""

In the latter part of the 1960s, Anthony and Deirdre became involved in the growing counterculture movement and started using recreational drugs. Deirdre developed an acquaintance with the Manson family, while Anthony became addicted to cocaine and heroin, giving it up in 1971. After recovering, Anthony became a television director, and directed 68 episodes of Murder, She Wrote, also marrying and having three children. Deirdre married a chef, and together they opened a restaurant in West Los Angeles. Lansbury is a cousin of the Postgate family, including the animator, writer and social activist Oliver Postgate, as well as the academic and novelist Coral Lansbury, whose son is former Prime Minister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull.

As a young actress, Lansbury was a self-professed homebody, commenting that ""I love the world of housekeeping."" She preferred spending quiet evenings inside with friends to the Hollywood night life. Her hobbies at the time included reading, horse riding, playing tennis, cooking, and playing the piano; she also had a keen interest in gardening. She has cited F. Scott Fitzgerald as her favorite author, and cited Roseanne and Seinfeld as being among her favorite television shows. Lansbury was an avid letter writer, doing so by hand and making copies of all her correspondences. At Howard Gotlieb's request, Lansbury's papers are housed at the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center at Boston University.

She is a supporter of the United States Democratic Party, describing herself as ""Democrat from the ground up"", and the British Labour Party. Throughout her career, Lansbury supported a variety of charities, particularly those such as Abused Wives in Crisis that combated domestic abuse and those who worked toward rehabilitating drug users. In the 1980s, she began to support a number of charities engaged in the fight against HIV/AIDS. In early life, she had been a chain smoker, giving up the addiction in the mid-1960s. In 1976 and 1987, she had cosmetic surgery on her neck to prevent it from broadening with age. During the 1990s, she began to suffer from arthritis, in May 1994 had hip replacement surgery, and in 2005 had knee replacement surgery.",N/A,N/A,N/A,British-American actress and singer,16/9/1925,1943–present,N/A,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Lansbury
Låpsley,"Låpsley was born in York. Her middle name, Lapsley, is her mother's maiden name. She changed ""Lapsley"" to ""Låpsley"" by adding the Scandinavian character Å, partly due to her perceived ties with Scandinavia through her Scottish heritage, as well as how it looked when written. She grew up in Southport, Merseyside, where she attended Greenbank High School and sixth form college at Formby High School.","Having been a member of several bands in the Merseyside area, Låpsley won the ""One to Watch"" prize at Merseyside's GIT (Getintothis) Award in April 2014, following over half a million listens of her solo bedroom-recorded Monday EP on SoundCloud.

Her debut single ""This Ain't The End"" was aired on MTV, and was sync and licensed as a film soundtrack. It tantalised fans of The Walking Dead by being linked to giving a clue as to who Negan would kill in the final episode of season 6.

She followed this up with the song ""My Summer"", for which she was executive producer and art director of the music video. Then came ""The Amazon"", an ecological call to the preservation of The Earth's lungs, the Amazon rainforest. For this she used sound recordings she made of crickets and birds in Brazil. A similar theme continued with her metaphorically titled song ""Zombietown"" which is set in a post-apocalyptic future caused by the negligence of the human race towards climate change.

Her first chart success came with the release of her song titled ""Ben"" which was featured on BBC Introducing and reached Number 1 in the iTunes Top Charts in Netherlands on 19 December 2017. The release of ""House On A Rocky Road"" cemented her success with another Number 1 hit in the Netherlands iTunes Charts, whilst this time breaking into the Top 40 in the UK chart causing Clash Music to call her a ""pop icon-in-waiting"" with the premiere of her follow up single ""Dancing With A Bottle"", her third Number 1 hit in the Netherlands and her second UK Top 40 hit.

Lindy Layton,N/A,"Layton attended the Barbara Speake Stage School in the 1980s and would go on to appear as an actor in a few TV shows such as Casualty and Press Gang (though many people have mistaken the latter for an appearance in Grange Hill on BBC One, getting Layton mixed up with an actor called Lindy Brill, who had also played a character called Cathy). In the early 1990s, Layton was part of Norman Cook's dance music collective Beats International which featured her as lead vocalist on a couple of singles, including the number-one hit ""Dub Be Good to Me"". Beats International's debut album, Let Them Eat Bingo, sold moderately.

Following the success of the singles with Beats International, in 1990, Layton signed a solo deal with Arista, and released her version of Janet Kay's hit, ""Silly Games"". The single was a notable hit, and further releases followed from her debut album, Pressure (released in 1991). However, these decreased in popularity with each release. Pressure was mostly produced by Norman Cook and the dance-soul-funk outfit Driza Bone. The album's second single, ""Echo My Heart"" narrowly missed out on a UK Top 40 placing in January 1991, while ""Wait For Love"" produced by Norman Cook failed to reach the UK Singles Chart altogether, in April of that year.

Layton's summer 1991 release of ""Without You (One and One)"" followed, again produced by Driza Bone. Although ""Without You (One and One)"" sold better than Layton's previous single, it still failed to reach the Top 40. Layton then released a one-off single for Debut Records in 1992. ""I'll Be a Freak for You"" was not a chart hit. The following year, Layton re-emerged with a new deal with PWL. The new material was more commercial, and two single releases of minor chart success were released in the UK: ""We Got the Love"" and ""Show Me"". Without the expected profitable return, Layton parted company with PWL.

In Japan, she released a pop-reggae album, entitled No Other Star in 1996, and went on to release other work as Hardknox with fellow DJ Steve Proctor the same year. They were signed to Skint Records and released their debut single ""Coz I Can"" which was given ""Single of the Week"" honours by NME.

Mary-Jess Leaverland,"Mary-Jess Leaverland is married to Rich Parker, a professional vert rollerblader.","Mary-Jess advanced through Min Xing Chang Fan Tian (or in English: I Want to Sing to the Stars) all the way to the final, where she won the grand prize after competing live on Chinese television every night for three weeks. After winning the contest however, Jess still remained virtually unknown in the UK. The show was not broadcast outside Jiangsu Province, China, so her family and friends could not watch it and her family could not afford to fly to China to watch her. When an interview she gave to a local Gloucester paper was picked up by the national press, the news spread, and Leaverland was offered several recording contracts and she signed a recording contract with Decca Records. She was signed to Decca from March 2010 to November 2011.

Mary-Jess stated in an interview with The Guardian that ""I was awful at French but Chinese caught my attention with all the different tones. Each word had its own tune."" The Music and Chinese Studies course at the University of Sheffield took Leaverland to Nanjing, and when she by chance came across auditions for the talent competition she wanted to get involved. ""I really thought they would want a Chinese person to win. I couldn't believe it when it was me.""

Her debut album Shine was released on 8 August 2011 and peaked at no. 57 on the UK Albums Chart. Before release she went on a 23-date UK tour with tenor Russell Watson as his special guest.

In December 2011, she appeared as a soloist on the BBC Songs of Praise broadcast from All Saints' Church, Cheltenham, and again on Easter Sunday, in April 2012.

Her song ""Stand as One"" was used as a background theme for P&G – Proud Sponsor of Mums TV advert in 2012. Mary-Jess was selected to sing the FA Cup Christian hymn ""Abide with Me"" before the 2012 FA Cup Final association football match between Chelsea and Liverpool. In 2013, she appeared at the Cheltenham Music Festival.In 2015, Mary-Jess was invited to No. 10 Downing Street and was asked to serve as a representative of the British Council's GREAT Britain Campaign to represent British music worldwide.In 2016, she conducted a short teaching tour of Suzhou, Lanzhou and Hangzhou, China with the British Council as part of The GREAT Britain Campaign. Later that year she released her second album 'Prayer to a Snowflake', a winter/Christmas album which features duets with Jaden Cornelious and Rhydian.

Scarlett Lee,"Lee, a British Romany, was born on 20 September 1997 in Surrey, England. Before The X Factor, Lee worked as a makeup artist. During The X Factor, Lee was involved in a fire, when her brother's caravan set alight. Lee was in the neighbouring caravan at the time, and was later taken into hospital. In January 2019, Lee became engaged to Nathan Shaw.","Lee first auditioned for The X Factor in 2017, where she reached the six-chair challenge in the girls category. She was briefly given a seat by her mentor Sharon Osbourne after her performance of ""Without You"" by David Guetta and Usher, but was later sent home after a dramatic sing-off between her and eventual finalists Rai-Elle Williams and Alisah Bonaobra, during which she sang ""The Power of Love"" by Jennifer Rush.

Lee re-auditioned for The X Factor in 2018. She performed her own original song ""Survival"", but was stopped by Simon Cowell, who was unimpressed with the song. As Cowell urged her to use her performance to convince the audience to root for her, she performed a cover of Loren Allred's ""Never Enough"" which earned her four yes votes from the judges. She successfully made it past bootcamp and the six-chair challenge to judges' houses in the girls category, mentored by Cowell. She was then chosen by Cowell for the live shows.

In the quarter-final's results, after the elimination of Bella Penfold and Shan Ako, she became the last act in the girls' category.

When I was about nine or 10, I remember hearing ""Silly Games"" by Janet Kay, with all those high notes, and thinking, ""Hmm, I wonder if I can do that?""

In 2008, Leigh stated that she hoped to become part of a musical movement bringing singers (as opposed to dancehall deejays) back to the forefront in reggae. As she told noted writer Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul: I think the reason we're now living in the decade of dancehall deejays is because everyone these days is so into hip hop and rap, and dancehall is basically the reggae version of that. But hopefully me doing this can help signal the start of many more successful new reggae vocalists to come.""

Leigh worked with writers such as Nick Manasseh, Future Cut and Feng Shui on her debut album, originally to be titled Turned on Underground. Partly recorded at Harry J's in Jamaica, the album was reviewed favourably and was described as having the ""slick appeal of a US R&B princess."" The album was released as a Promo CD titled Rollin' but never received a full release after the singles ""La La La"" and ""Mad About the Boy"" did not achieve commercial success. Leigh released a four-track extended play (EP) of recordings from the album titled La La La, on 5 January 2009.

Leigh's song ""Mad About the Boy"" was featured on the film Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging, and her version of ""Mas Que Nada"" was featured in a 2008 TV commercial for chain store Next's summer clothing range. In 2008, Leigh co-wrote Joss Stone's digital download single ""Governmentalist"", featuring Nas.","

Dua Lipa,"Dua Lipa was born in London, the eldest child of Kosovo Albanian parents Anesa and Dukagjin Lipa from Pristina, FR Yugoslavia (present-day Kosovo). Her family is of Muslim heritage. Through her maternal grandmother, she is of Bosnian descent. Her ancestry can also be traced back to the city of Peja, Kosovo. Both of her grandfathers were historians. She has a sister named Rina and a brother named Gjin Lipa. Lipa was musically influenced by her father,  who was the lead singer and guitarist of the Kosovan rock band Oda. Her father continued to play music at home, including his own compositions and songs of artists such as David Bowie, Bob Dylan, Radiohead, Sting, The Police and Stereophonics. Lipa started singing at the age of five.

Lipa grew up in West Hampstead, London. She attended Fitzjohn's Primary School, where her music lessons included the cello. When she auditioned to enter the school choir, the teacher told her that ""she could not sing"". At the age of nine, she began weekend singing lessons at the Sylvia Young Theatre School. Lipa moved with her family to Pristina after Kosovo declared independence in 2008. There, she learned more about the Albanian language and considered a musical career.

Lipa moved back to London at age 15. At Parliament Hill School she achieved her A-Levels, then re-entered Sylvia Young Theatre School part-time. She uploaded her own songs to SoundCloud, and on YouTube. She began posting videos of herself covering songs such as ""If I Ain't Got You"" (2004) by Alicia Keys and ""Beautiful"" (2002) by Christina Aguilera on YouTube. Lipa modeled with Topshop, and signed with a modelling agency, helping her land a role as a ""singer"" in an ITV advertisement for The X Factor in 2013, covering the song ""Lost in Music"" (1979). She acquired a producer and a manager.","In 2013, Lipa signed a contract with Tap Management, directed by Ben Mawson and Ed Millett, while working as a waitress in a cocktail bar. Lipa was introduced to Mawson by her lawyer, who discouraged her from signing another publishing deal that was offered to her. Subsequently, they offered her a monthly salary to leave her job and focus on recording music. During one of the sessions, Lipa co-wrote the song ""Hotter than Hell"", which would eventually lead to her signing a record deal with Warner Bros. Records in 2014. Millett retrospectively elaborated: ""Dua was really smart – she signed to Warner Bros. partly because they didn't have a big female pop artist and they needed one. They really wanted her, so she had the focus of the team from day one."" In August 2015, Lipa released her first single ""New Love"", produced by Emile Haynie and Andrew Wyatt. Her second single, ""Be the One"", was issued to European success in October 2015, reaching number one in Belgium, Poland and Slovakia, as well as charting within the top ten in over eleven European territories.

Little Boots,"Hesketh was born in Blackpool, Lancashire. Her father has a car sales business and her mother is a writer. The oldest sibling with three brothers, she was raised in Thornton, Lancashire.

From the age of five, Hesketh played the piano and began lessons at six with Ruth Birchall, eventually winning a music scholarship. During this time she was taught how to play the flute, was a member of the school choir and travelled regularly to Manchester to take lessons on her harp. Trained initially in classical singing by Janet Wunderley, by the age of thirteen Hesketh was writing her own songs.

Hesketh attended the private Rossall School in Fleetwood, and then the state Blackpool Sixth Form College; it was around this time that she entered the ITV talent competition search Pop Idol aged sixteen. Reaching the third round, she was eliminated by the producers of the show and did not reach the panel of judges. She stated, ""It gave me a thicker skin and it made me realise that it wasn't a short cut to getting where I wanted to be.""

After singing with the Lancashire Youth Jazz Orchestra and performing with a jazz trio for some time Hesketh decided to prioritise her education and studied cultural studies at the University of Leeds, attaining a first-class honours degree. She subsidised her course by playing ""awful, schmoozy lounge versions of Norah Jones songs"" in hotels around the north-west. ""It paid me loads of money, but it's not what I wanted to be doing"" she said. It was during her time at Leeds University that Hesketh, along with two of her fellow students, formed the all-female band Dead Disco, Hesketh herself eventually becoming the lead singer.

While studying at the University of Leeds, Hesketh answered an online advertisement posted by Lucy Catherwood and Marie France looking for a lead singer to start a band. Sharing an interest and love of The Killers, Ladytron, The Rapture and Siouxsie & the Banshees, they formed the electropunk band Dead Disco in August 2005, The band got their name through randomly picking words from a hat. With Dead Disco, Hesketh sang lead vocals and played synth, while Catherwood and Franceon played guitar and bass, respectively.

With only a few songs written, Dead Disco began playing gigs around the north of England; their live gig in the headline slot at the ""In the City"" event in Manchester gained them enough recognition to get a recording stint with James Ford. Working with Ford in his London attic studio, the band issued a limited release of their debut single ""The Treatment"" in April 2006 on the record label High Voltage. Their second release ""City Place"" was a digital-only release through Playlouder Records.

With the success of several sell out gigs and an appearance at the Leeds Festival, the band moved to Los Angeles to begin recording their debut album with Greg Kurstin. However, it was around this time that Hesketh herself began to write songs not in keeping with the band's ""indie"" style. Choosing a new musical direction, Hesketh left Dead Disco; they officially revealed their disbandment on their Myspace blog in December 2008. In an interview with The Times, Hesketh spoke about her gradual shift away from the band: ""All the time I'd been hiding my own songs and finally I had to make the sort of music I actually wanted to listen to. [...] Before I used to always think, 'What would a jazz performer do?' or 'What would the band do?'—Now it's so easy because it's 'What would I do?' It's just me."" In a later interview Hesketh noted that the bands' label was pressuring the group to have a certain style and that her bandmates lost confidence in her because she wanted to write ""cheesy"" songs.With her departure from Dead Disco in August 2007, Hesketh decided to begin a new solo career in pop. She returned to her parents' house to begin writing her own songs and posting covers on social networking sites such as YouTube and Myspace. Within a year she had narrowed down a list of her songs to create an album and by getting in touch with Greg Kurstin, with whom she had previously worked with Dead Disco, Hesketh started production on her debut album Hands. In early 2008 she began using the stage name Little Boots, which came from a nickname given to her by a friend, a reference to her unusually small feet. She shares her nickname with the ancient Roman emperor Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, who was better known by his nickname Caligula (Latin for ""Little Boot"").

After appearing on several shows including Later... with Jools Holland and Last Call with Carson Daly, Hesketh entered production on her debut album Hands. The album was recorded in Los Angeles with Greg Kurstin and Joe Goddard, and by January 2009 she had begun to compile the album's track listings. With increasing media attention regarding her then-yet-to-be-released debut album, Hesketh topped the BBC Sound of 2009 poll and received a Critics' Choice nomination at the 2009 BRIT Awards.

Hands was released in June 2009, accompanied by a limited edition 12-inch vinyl release (limited to 1000 copies). The album peaked at number five on the UK Albums Chart and has produced the top twenty hit ""New in Town"" and top ten hit ""Remedy"". The album also did well in Europe and Japan. Also in June 2009, Little Boots released an EP titled Illuminations in the United States and Canada. It includes ""Stuck on Repeat"", ""New in Town"", ""Magical"", ""Love Kills"" (a cover of Freddie Mercury's 1984 song) and ""Not Now"" (which is only available on the US edition). Designed to help relaunch Elektra Records, the EP peaked at number fourteen on the Billboard Dance/Electronic Albums chart.

Critical response to the album was generally favourable, generating a score of 70 on Metacritic. In a review for musicOMH, Michael Cragg called it ""a well-crafted, glorious pop record."" ClashMusic.com reviewer Joe Zadeh disagreed, writing that the album ""falls victim to attempts to reach beyond more boundaries than necessary, and thus ironically loses the concentration of the more earnest listener."" David Renshaw of Gigwise.com described Hands as ""a big pop album"" that ""rival[s] Lady Gaga, Girls Aloud or Lily Allen."" Ben Thompson of The Guardian wrote that the album's production was ""diverse"" and called the song ""Symmetry"", a duet with Philip Oakey, a ""joyous cross-generational head-to-head."" NME reviewer Emily Mackay wrote that ""Little Boots gives us an inspiring story of self-realization"" and called the album ""brilliant."" Pete Paphides of The Times named ""Stuck on Repeat"" the album's ""best moment"" due to its ""exquisite vulnerability."" Little Boots was also nominated for Critics' Choice at the 2009 Brit Awards. She was included on Esquire magazine's list of sixty ""Brilliant Brits 2009"", and was named a 2009 artist to watch by American magazine Rolling Stone.

Little Boots collaborated with illustrator and artist Chrissie Abbott for the artwork of the album. The artwork for the album has been compared to Pink Floyd's 1973 album The Dark Side of the Moon because of its geometric design and fairytale imagery. The album was released in the United States on 2 March 2010, debuting at number seven on the Heatseekers Albums chart. With the release of her debut, she was linked to a recent wave of breakthrough female artists in their 20s playing 1980s-influenced music, including Lady Gaga, Ladyhawke, Florence and the Machine and Elly Jackson of La Roux.In an interview with music website Artistdirect in March 2010, Little Boots stated that her second album would be ""rawer and a bit more down-to-earth. It'll still be magical, but quite dark and spooky at the same time."" She added that she had drawn inspiration from the poetry of Edgar Allan Poe. In May 2011, she performed at China Music Valley Music Festival in Beijing, during which she performed a new song called ""Crescendo"". In late September 2011, Little Boots performed several old and new songs acoustically at the Mondrian Hotel in Los Angeles. In October 2011, she released a mixtape called Shake Until Your Heart Breaks and announced that she would embark on an international DJ tour to promote her new material. She released the song ""Shake"" digitally and on a limited edition vinyl in November 2011. Little Boots collaborated with English electronic producer Michael Woods on the song ""I Wish"", which premiered during Woods's set on BBC Radio 1's Essential Mix on in December 2011.

Little Boots unveiled her third mixtape, Into the Future, in March 2012 via her official SoundCloud page. The mix includes re-workings of Azari & III's ""Reckless with Your Love"" and Kylie Minogue's ""Slow"", and a Tensnake remix of ""Every Night I Say a Prayer"", a song she wrote with Andy Butler of Hercules and Love Affair. ""Every Night I Say a Prayer"" was released in April 2012 as a free digital download and—to coincide with Record Store Day—on limited 12-inch vinyl via 679 and Trax Records. She supported the launch with a short live set at Rough Trade East in London. This was followed by ""Headphones"", released in June 2012, with the accompanying music video inspired by Paris, Texas. Little Boots toured internationally in late 2012, including performances at San Francisco's Folsom Street Fair and Ibiza's Space.

In January 2013, Little Boots released two tracks on vinyl, ""Superstitious Heart"" and ""Whatever Makes You Happy"", under the pseudonym LB. Her second album, Nocturnes, was released in May 2013 and features the singles ""Shake"", ""Every Night I Say a Prayer"" and ""Broken Record"". In an interview with This Is Fake DIY, Little Boots said of the album: ""I feel a lot more at peace about where I'm at creatively as an artist now than a year or so ago [...] I think everyone is always nervous releasing anything they've created into the world, but I've realised what I want to do and how I can achieve it, rather than trying to please other people."" Sonically, she stated Nocturnes ""definitely feels more representative of me of an artist, at least now in 2012. It's less 80s synth pop influenced, it's quite an upbeat album, which I think has stemmed from the fact I have been DJing a lot, and listening to a lot of dance music."" She has also characterised the album as ""still electronic but draws a lot more influences from early house music and classic disco.""Little Boots released her fifth EP, Business Pleasure, in December 2014. The lead single, ""Taste It"", premiered the preceding month. Her third studio album, Working Girl, was released in July 2015 via her own label, On Repeat Records. In August 2015 it was announced that she had collaborated with Jean-Michel Jarre on the track ""If..!"" from the album Electronica. The track was released as a single ahead of the release of the album with accompanying promotional video. A remix competition for the track was also announced on the Talenthouse website. In June 2016 Little Boots announced her sixth EP titled After Hours as a continuation of her Working Girl era. The lead single Staring at the Sun was released on worldwide on 3 June 2016 with the EP being released on 17 June 2016.Little Boots released her seventh EP Burn on 6 April 2018. The EP features 4 songs, all of which are collaborative efforts with female producers. The EP was preceded by single ""Shadows"".

Cher Lloyd,"Cher Lloyd was raised in Malvern, Worcestershire, with her parents Darren and Diane and her three younger siblings, Sophie, Josh, and Rosie. Her family is of Romani origin, and Lloyd spent the first year of her life travelling around Wales with her young parents in a caravan. Speaking to Now, her uncle said she was teased and bullied by classmates due to her origins. Lloyd attended The Chase School, Malvern, and later Dyson Perrins High School, where she studied performing arts. She also attended the theater arts school Stagecoach.","Lloyd had previously auditioned for The X Factor before (when the minimum age was lower), singing ballads, but did not make it through. She had previously performed at holiday camps and said she received a mixed reaction to her music, but was a big hit with X Factor judges at the time. She auditioned singing the Keri Hilson version of ""Turn My Swag On"" by Soulja Boy. At bootcamp she sang a rap version of ""Viva La Vida"". At the judges' houses, she performed ""Cooler Than Me"" but suffered from tonsillitis and was unable to complete the song.

Lloyd sang a rendition of ""Just Be Good to Me"" in the first of the live shows. In the second live show, she performed ""Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)."" In the third live show, she sang a mashup of ""No Diggity"" and ""Shout"", and in the fourth live show, she sang ""Stay."" This was the first time Lloyd did not rap in her performance, and Cowell even called it ""the performance of the series."" In week five, Lloyd sang ""Empire State of Mind"", but the judges stated that after the previous week they were disappointed. However, they agreed that she redeemed herself with her rendition of ""Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word"" mixed with ""Mockingbird"", by Elton John and Eminem, respectively, in week 6. In the seventh week, Lloyd was in the bottom two for the first time after her rendition of ""Imagine"", but Cowell, Cole and Walsh all saved her in the final showdown. In the following week, Lloyd performed ""Girlfriend"", followed by ""Walk This Way"". Both performances were credited by the judges, and she was saved by the public vote the following night, securing her position in the semifinal. In the semifinal, Lloyd performed ""Nothin' on You"" and ""Love the Way You Lie"" and was in the bottom two with Mary Byrne. She was saved by the judges again and put through to the final. In the final, she performed a mashup of ""The Clapping Song"" and ""Get Ur Freak On"", followed by a duet with will.i.am, which was a mashup of ""Where Is the Love?"" and ""I Gotta Feeling."" Lloyd was then eliminated in fourth place, having received the fewest public votes.

Lloyd and nine other contestants from the series participated in the X Factor Live Tour from February 2011 to April 2011. The tour saw Lloyd performing for 500,000 people throughout the UK.Auditions—Free choice—""Turn My Swag On""—Through to bootcamp,Bootcamp—Solo performance—""Viva La Vida""—Through to judges' houses,Judges' houses—Free choice—""Cooler Than Me""—Through to live shows,Live show 1—Number-one singles—""Just Be Good to Me""—Safe (3rd),Live show 2—Heroes—""It's the Hard Knock Life""/""Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)""—Safe (6th),Live show 3—Guilty Pleasures—""No Diggity""/""Shout""—Safe (4th),Live show 4—Halloween—""Stay""—Safe (2nd),Live show 5—American anthems—""Empire State of Mind""—Safe (5th),Live show 6—Songs by Elton John—""Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word""/""Mockingbird""—Safe (5th),Live show 7—Songs by The Beatles—""Imagine""—Bottom two (8th),Live show 7—Final showdown—""Stay""—Bottom two (8th),Live show 8—Rock—""Girlfriend""—Safe (3rd),Live show 8—Rock—""Walk This Way""—Safe (3rd),Semi-final—Club Classics—""Nothin' on You""—Bottom two (5th),Semi-final—Song to get you to the final—""Love the Way You Lie""—Bottom two (5th),Semi-final—Final showdown—""Everytime""—Bottom two (5th),Final—Free choice—""The Clapping Song""/""Get Ur Freak On""—Eliminated (4th),Final—Mentor duets—""Where Is the Love?""/""I Gotta Feeling"" with will.i.am—Eliminated (4th),After the finale of the seventh series of The X Factor, it was announced that Lloyd had been signed to Syco Music. Shortly after, recording began for her debut studio album with songwriter Autumn Rowe, and producers RedOne, Johnny Powers and The Runners. On 28 July 2011, Lloyd previewed five tracks from the album during a UStream session, including singles featuring Busta Rhymes, Mike Posner, Ghetts, Mic Righteous and Dot Rotten.

Lloyd's debut single, ""Swagger Jagger"", was released in July 2011 and entered at number one on the UK Singles Chart, with sales exceeding 303,000 copies in Britain. In the Republic of Ireland, the single charted at number two on the Irish Singles Chart. The single debuted at number 79 on the Mega Top 100 in the Netherlands. After a performance during the finals of So You Think You Can Dance, the song moved up the chart to number 60. Lloyd released her debut studio album, Sticks + Stones, on 4 November 2011. The record entered the UK Albums Chart at number four, and peaked at number seven in Ireland. The album sold 55,668 copies in its opening week. The second single, ""With Ur Love"", featuring American singer Mike Posner, debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number four with first-week sales of 74,030 copies. The song sold more than the first single, when it debuted at number one in August 2011, selling 66,316 copies. ""With Ur Love"" also marks the highest-selling number-four single since Rihanna's ""Only Girl (In the World),"" which sold 74,248 copies in 2010. The third single, ""Want U Back"", featuring American rapper Astro, debuted at number 56, and rose 30 places to number 26 with sales of 9,730.

In November 2011, Lloyd announced her debut headlining UK tour, the Sticks and Stones Tour, which took place in March and April 2012. On 13 December, a music video for ""Dub on the Track,"" featuring underground artists Mic Righteous, Dot Rotten and Ghetts, who also all appear in the accompanying video, premiered on SBTV.

In October 2011, Lloyd signed to Logan Media Entertainment under the management of Craig Logan, John Black and Christie LaRocque.

In December 2011, Lloyd signed a record deal with L.A. Reid to Epic Records in the United States; a solo version of ""Want U Back"" was confirmed as Lloyd's debut single in the US and the first one from the American and Australian release of Sticks and Stones. The song was released in May 2012 and debuted at number 75 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart before rising to number 12. It also peaked at number 9 on Billboard Pop Songs, number 5 on Digital Songs, number 39 on the Hot 100 Airplay, and number 23 on Adult Pop Songs. It also debuted at number 95 on the Canadian Hot 100 chart and peaked at number 11. As of February 2013, the track has sold over 2,000,000 copies in the US, and almost 3,000,000 copies worldwide. The second US single, ""Oath"", featuring American rapper Becky G, was released on October, but failed to match its predecessor's success, peaking at number 73 in the US Billboard Hot 100. In New Zealand, following the major success of ""Want U Back,"" which reached number 3, ""Oath"" made a respectable impact, peaking at number 13, becoming Lloyd's third consecutive Top 20 hit in that country. The American and Australian versions of Sticks and Stones were released on 2 October 2012, through Epic Records. This edition peaked at number nine in the US selling 32,948 copies in its opening week; it has sold more than 250,000 copies in the country as of September 2017. The album reached number thirty in Australia. In October 2012, Lloyd supported American band Hot Chelle Rae on the Australian leg of their Whatever World Tour.Months after the release of Sticks + Stones, Lloyd confirmed reports that recording had begun for her second studio album, with new songwriters and producers such as Beth Ditto and Tove Lo. In January 2013, Lloyd announced that she would guest-star on Big Time Rush. In April 2013, Lloyd announced she and Ne-Yo were to collaborate on a new Fruttare song, ""It's All Good,"" which premiered in June of that year. In November 2013, during an interview with Larry King, Lloyd confirmed that she had left Syco Music after she and Cowell disagreed about her career path in music. Lloyd also confirmed that the album, which was originally due for release in November, was pushed back until early 2014, despite the record being done.

She also revealed that her I Wish Tour would take place in the fall of 2013 and that girl group Fifth Harmony would serve as the opening act. In May 2014, Lloyd was featured on ""Really Don't Care"", the fourth single off Demi Lovato's fourth album Demi, which peaked at number one on the US Dance chart and debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 98 before rising to peak position number 26.

Lloyd's second studio album, Sorry I'm Late, was released on 23 May 2014, and peaked on the US Billboard 200 chart at number 12. The album peaked at number 58 on the Irish Albums Chart, while it debuted at number 21 on the UK Albums Chart. The lead single, ""I Wish"", featuring American rapper T.I., debuted within the US on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart at number 17. It also charted on the ARIA Singles Chart at number 40 and on New Zealand at number 16. The second single, ""Sirens"", peaked on the US Billboard Pop Digital Songs chart at number 48. Also the song charted on the UK Singles Chart at number 41. The album sold 41,000 copies in the US despite the little chart success.

Following the release of Sorry I'm Late, Lloyd was removed from Epic's website, leading to the suspicion that she had been dropped by the label. In November 2014, it was revealed that Lloyd had signed a new deal with Universal Music Group and was working on her third studio album.Lloyd broke her silence in March 2016 by posting a video on her social media pages. In the video, Lloyd states: ""I just want to say thank you so much for being so patient. It's been a while but it's definitely worth the wait and I can't wait for everybody to hear it."" Lloyd stated in an interview with New You Media that her third album is almost finished. On 15 July 2016, Lloyd teased the release of her new song, ""Activated"", on social media; the song premiered on 22 July 2016. In May 2017, Lloyd announced that she had signed with ie:music.

On 11 October 2019, she released the single ""M.I.A"". The song will be the lead single from her upcoming third studio album.

After leaving school she played her first shows as Rita & The Piss Artists an all-girl punk band. Playing bass guitar – 'seemed the easiest' – the band became an excuse to get drunk a lot.

The song is the second and more experimental remix half of a single to be released, while ""Who's Loving You (Part 1)"" is a full track, dropping the majority of the drum and bass sound that Part 2 boasts. In the interview section of the BBC Radio 1 stream, High Contrast commented that Maguire is exactly like ""The female Johnny Cash"", Cash being one of Maguire's biggest influences.In February, she had a live performance of 'Shadow' at the Burberry Prorsum A/W catwalk show. Maguire released her sixth EP, Don't Mess Me Around, on 23 February 2015.

On 24 March 2016, Maguire released the lead single, ""Elizabeth Taylor"", from her second studio album, Stranger Things Have Happened, released on 27 May 2016. The album features songs both previously heard before and new additions to the blues vibe that the album encompasses. On 9 February 2018, Maguire released the single ""All or Nothing Love"".

On 26 March 2021 Will Young confirmed he would be covering one of Maguires songs following the announcement of the release of his eighth studio album Crying on the Bathroom Floor. Following the release, Young said: ""I loved the idea of creating an album that celebrates some of the modern female artists I so admire in pop. In today's times it's so much easier and accepted to occupy other genders, ideas and explore new avenues. I wanted to understand what it might be like to sing their lyrics. A song about a boy called Daniel; crying on the bathroom floor, feeling like Elizabeth Taylor. This is not a covers album as such, well certainly not in the standard way. I wanted to bring songs from female artists who I admire into a new arena.""

On 19 May 2021 Maguire confirmed the release of Light After Dark on vinyl for the first time ever to celebrate the albums ten year anniversary.","

Laura Marling,"Marling is the youngest of three daughters. Her mother is a music teacher. Marling's father, Charles William Somerset Marling, ran a recording studio, introduced her to folk music, and shaped her musical taste, an experience that Marling later described as, ""a bit of a blessing and a bit of a curse. ... [because] I couldn't slot myself into the age-appropriate genre"". She learned guitar at an early age.

Marling attended Waverly Primary School in Finchampstead, Berkshire, and received a scholarship to attend Leighton Park School, a private Quaker school in Reading, Berkshire. During her secondary school years she felt uneasy around other people and was afraid of death.","Marling was invited to tour with Jamie T after he attended her second solo gig. She has toured with a number of other musicians including Adam Green from the anti-folk band The Moldy Peaches. She performed at the 2007 O2 Wireless Festival and at the first Underage Festival in August 2007 at Victoria Park, East London, before releasing her debut EP ""London Town"" on WayOutWest Records.

Her debut album Alas, I Cannot Swim was released on 4 February 2008, and was nominated for the 2008 Mercury Prize. The album, as well as subsequent singles, were released on Virgin Records. The third and final single from her album, ""Night Terror"" was released on 27 October 2008, coinciding with a six-date ""Night Terror tour"".

Marling's television appearances include The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson and Later With Jools Holland, performing ""Ghosts"" and ""New Romantic"", respectively. In 2008, she appeared on Russell Brand's Radio 2 show alongside her sister. She once chose to perform on the street after being denied entry to one of her own performances for being underage.

The follow-up to Alas, I Cannot Swim, titled I Speak Because I Can, was released on 22 March 2010. Produced by Ethan Johns, the album has a more mature sound and lyricism, dealing with ""responsibility, particularly the responsibility of womanhood"". The album is preceded by her singles ""Goodbye England (Covered in Snow)"", released on iTunes in December 2009, and ""Devil's Spoke"", released on 15 March 2010. On 28 March 2010, I Speak Because I Can entered the UK Albums Chart at Number 4. It was nominated for the 2010 Mercury Music Prize. In 2013, NME listed the album at 263 in their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

Marling's third album, A Creature I Don't Know, was released on 12 September 2011. The album received positive reviews and reached number four on the UK album charts.During October 2012, Marling completed the 'Working Holiday Tour' of the US as a solo performer. At the time, she announced that the fourth album, later named Once I Was an Eagle, was finished and was scheduled for a February 2013 release; this was later delayed until May 2013. On 8 March 2013, Marling confirmed that the album would be released on 27 May 2013 and would be released in the US one day later.

Marling's fourth album's first single, ""Master Hunter"", was released on 17 April 2013, while Once I Was an Eagle entered the UK charts at number 3.

Following the release of the album, Marling revealed that she only listened to ""music made between 1969 and 1972"" during the songwriting process for the album and described it as an era when ""guitar was becoming a kind of masculine extension"". Marling explained during the post-release promotional period that she sought a minimalist approach for the fourth album and, in contrast to the previous two albums, recorded all of the songs without a band.

Once I Was an Eagle is Marling's third album to be nominated for the Mercury Prize. The 2013 award was eventually won by James Blake.

Marling revealed in a September 2013 interview that she had enough songs for a fifth album at the time, and she will ""maybe make this record and then have a big, long, hard think about what I've done"". During a February 2014 performance for NPR's ""eTown"" series, Marling played one of the new songs, titled ""Born to Love"".

During a European tour for her fourth album, Marling expressed doubts about her long-term commitment to the music industry in an interview:

When I play, I am very much in the space where I was when I wrote the music. You could slay me quite easily, I'm at my most vulnerable. I am very private, in all aspects of my life, to everybody, so why is it that I get up on stage every night and open myself in front of strangers? I'm not sure if I've got the bottle for it, any more.

Marling added that she is sometimes surprised by her profession in relation to the music industry as a whole and often thinks, ""oh, I exist in this industry"" when listening to the radio, saying that she is unsure if she wants to remain in such a position.On 16 December 2014, Marling announced that her fifth studio album would be titled Short Movie. The album's title track, released on the same date, is the lead single and was made available for digital download. The album features 13 songs composed by Marling and was released in the UK on 23 March 2015 and one day later in the US.

Marling began recording songs for the album shortly after completing the solo tour for Once I Was an Eagle. The songs were written in the US, reflecting Marling's experience of living in Los Angeles. However, after recording a new album, she felt unsatisfied with the result, and made the decision to scrap most of the songs written in that period. During this time, she became involved in activities unrelated to music. When production later resumed, she completed the album with her band at Urchin Studios in London. Marling produced the album alongside Dan Cox and Matt Ingram.

The second single from the record, ""False Hope"", premiered on 20 January. The track was available for digital download the next day. Both ""False Hope"" and ""Short Movie"" were received with critical acclaim, many reviewers noting the larger sound and the confidence in Marling's vocals.

In October 2015, Marling announced a short Tour de Ville through the US, where she would be previewing material from her forthcoming sixth studio album.

In a tweet, Blake Mills confirmed that Marling's sixth studio album was completed. In November 2016, Marling announced the release of Semper Femina in March 2017, with ""Soothing"" being the first single from the record. The album was released to critical acclaim. Marling received her first Grammy nomination for Best Folk Album for Semper Femina, but did not win the award. Semper Femina was also nominated for IMPALA's European Album of the Year Award.

Marling covered ""Red Right Hand"" by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and ""A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall"" by Bob Dylan for the Season 4 finale of Peaky Blinders which aired on 20 December 2017.In 2018, Marling announced that she would be recording an album with Mike Lindsay of the band Tunng, under the name LUMP. Prior to releasing an album, the duo released two singles, ""Curse of the Contemporary"" and ""Late to the Flight"". On 1 June 2018, LUMP released its self-titled debut album. Marling provided the vocals and lyrics, while Lindsay played most of the instruments on the album.On 5 April 2020, Marling announced the upcoming release of her seventh solo album via an Instagram post, also releasing a song off the album, ""Held Down"", at midnight. Song for Our Daughter was released on the 10 April 2020. The album, which had been set for release in August 2020, was released early, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic also caused Marling to cancel many 2020 tour dates.

The songs from the album featured predominately in several notable online performances including Live at the Union Chapel: live-streamed on 6 June 2020, with a selection of songs being pressed to limited edition vinyl, The Lockdown Sessions: recorded at Marling's home in April 2020 and released as part of Rough Trade's albums of the year in December, and the 6 Music Festival: her 'headline' solo performance on 26 March 2021 that also included a performance of a new track, titled ""The Shadows"".

On 22 March 2021, Marling announced dates for a UK tour in October 2021 performing the songs from Song for Our Daughter live for an audience for the first time.

On 5 May 2021, Marling announced that the follow-up album to her collaboration with Mike Lindsay as LUMP, will be released on 30 July, entitled Animal. The announcement came with the release of the lead single, sharing the same name.","

In June 2014 she released her debut EP Ribbon. In August 2014 Marten played the BBC Introducing stage at the Reading Festival. She described her music in December 2014 as ""a mix between acoustic and quite folky and a little indie.""

Jill Martin,"Jill Martin was born in Redruth, Cornwall, on 25 April 1938. When she was six, her father was killed in Second World War action and she found consolation in songs from musicals and danced on the window ledge in her mother's public house. Martin was educated at The Lawn School at St Austell. While Martin's song teacher believed that her student had the voice of an opera singer, she was impatient and she perceived opera as a more competitive industry than musicals.

Martin debuted in the theatre in 1950 with the chorus of Love from Judy at the Golders Green Hippodrome. She toured with the musical for the next two years and then appeared opposite George Formby in Dick Whittington at the Palace Theatre, London for one season. Afterwards, Martin had a lengthy spell of unemployment from theatre and she took up employment as a cleaner at a women's theatre club for three months. She was scouted by the theatre manager Binkie Beaumont, who cast her as a chorus girl and understudy for the musical Where's Charley? in 1958. That year, Martin was cast as second understudy to Julie Andrews who was playing Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and later appeared in the role of Rosalia in the West End musical of West Side Story at Her Majesty's Theatre. She later understudied for Roberta D'Esti as Maria.

On one occasion, Martin's grandmother and mother read an issue of the newspaper The Stage and decided that Martin should attend an open audition for the junior lead in Joie de Vivre. She won the part through being acquainted with the director William Chappell, and was escorted to the Theatre Girls' Club in Soho, where young actress were tended to and she took lessons in drawing, sewing, singing and gymnastics. The performance closed after four performances due to poor press reviews and commercial success. Martin remained in Soho and practised in the Theatre Girls' Club on an out-of-tune piano and a worn ballet barre. In 1966, she produced a studio cast recording alongside the actor David Holliday for the Music for Pleasure record label.

At the end of the 1960s Martin joined the casat of Fiddler on the Roof at Her Majesty's Theatre, playing Hodel, before returning to the West End to appear in Tom Brown's School Days at the Cambridge Theatre in 1972 and then Cockie! at the Vaudeville Theatre in 1973. She had a further role in Side by Side by Sondheim at the Garrick Theatre in 1978.  The following year, she took over the lead role of Eliza Doolittle from Liz Robertson in a revival of My Fair Lady. Martin was part in the original cast of Les Misérables at the Barbican Centre in 1985. She also appeared in Follies at the Shaftesbury Theatre two years later, as well as The Baker's Wife at the Phoenix Theatre in 1989.

Roles in the 1990s and the 2000s included Allegro (1993), Floyd Collins (1999) and Lautrec (2000). Martin understudied the role of Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard at its final year at the Adelphi Theatre in 1997. In 2001, she played Mrs Eynsford-Hill in another revival of My Fair Lady, becoming the only actor to appear in all three runs of the musical in the West End. Martin took two minor roles in Acorn Antiques: The Musical! at the Theatre Royal in 2005 and was one of six actresses to be part of a rendition of the song ""Wouldn't It Be Loverly"" at a plaque unveiling ceremony for lyricist Alan Jay Lerner the next year.

But they’re both genuine."" Also, she said: ""Just about everybody in the world knows about Miss Marple and has an opinion of what she should be like, so I’m under no illusions about the size of the task ahead."" McKenzie's first series of Marple comprised A Pocket Full of Rye, Murder Is Easy, They Do It with Mirrors and Why Didn't They Ask Evans?.

Her parents married in 1971 and separated in 1978, when Chisholm was four years old. Her mother remarried and had more children, one of whom is racing driver Paul O'Neill, who was born when Chisholm was six years old. She grew up in Widnes, Cheshire, attending Brookvale Junior School in nearby Runcorn and Fairfield High School in Widnes. Following school, she studied for a diploma course in dance, singing, drama, and musical theatre at the Doreen Bird College of Performing Arts in London. During college, she replied to an advert in The Stage placed by Chris and Bob Herbert, who were looking to form a new girl group, later to become the Spice Girls. She left college just short of completing her three-year course, and gained teaching qualifications in tap and modern theatre dance with the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing.","In 1994, Chisholm, along with Mel B, Geri Halliwell, and Victoria Beckham (née Adams) responded to an advertisement in The Stage magazine. Around 400 women who answered the ad went to Dance Works studios. Halliwell, Chisholm, Beckham and Brown were originally chosen as the members of the group, and then formed a quintet with Emma Bunton. The group felt insecure about the lack of a contract and were frustrated by the direction of Heart Management and broke with them. In 1995, they toured record labels in London and Los Angeles and finally signed a deal with Virgin. Their debut album, Spice, was a huge worldwide commercial success, peaked at number 1 in more than 17 countries across the world, and was certified multi-platinum in 27 countries. Conceptually, the album centered on the idea of Girl Power, and during that time was compared to Beatlemania. In total the album sold 30 million copies worldwide,  becoming the biggest-selling album in music history by a girl group and one of the most successful albums of all time.

""Viva Forever"", another number 1, was the last single before Geri Halliwell's departure from the group in May 1998. ""Never Give Up on the Good Times"" was planned as fifth single, but was cancelled after this event. With four members, the group released ""Goodbye"", before Christmas in 1998 and when it topped the UK Singles Chart it became their third consecutive Christmas number-one – equalling the record previously set by the Beatles. On 30 November, Canadian artist Bryan Adams, released ""When You're Gone"" with featured vocals of Chisholm, her debut solo project.

The song, featuring TLC member Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes, was released on 20 March 2000 and became her first number 1 single. It was received gold certification in the UK and also peaked at number 1 in Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland and Sweden.

""In and Out of Love"" was released as the album's third single on 29 July 2020. On 3 August 2020, Chisholm told BBC Music: ""Obviously, I'm making a pop-dance record and I'm a mature artist, so I have to accept that some radio stations are not going to be playing me anymore. That's something to overcome. But I want people to enjoy this album, I want people to dance to it, I want people to be empowered by it. And when coronavirus has done one, I want to get out there and perform it live."" On 16 September 2020, Chisholm premiered the video for ""Fearless"" the fourth single off the album, which is a collaboration with UK rapper Nadia Rose. ""Meeting Nadia was kismet. I'd seen her on Kathy Burke's documentary series on women and fallen in love with her attitude. As female artists, we have to be fearless. I love this girl."" Melanie C was released on 2 October 2020 to critical success. The album entered the UK Albums Chart at number 8, her first top 10 album since Reason in 2003.

On 13 November 2020, Chisholm was featured on ""Stop Crying Your Heart Out"" as part of the BBC Radio 2's Allstars' Children in Need charity single. Chisholm also made a guest appearance in British singer-songwriter Celeste's music video, ""Love is Back"", which premiered in January 2021. Chisholm was presented with the ""Celebrity Ally"" award at the 2021 British LGBT Awards, held in London in August.

On 3 September 2021, Chisholm released a deluxe version of her Melanie C album across all digital and streaming services. Chisholm premiered a video for her cover of ""Touch Me"" to accompany the new release. That same month, Chisholm was announced as a contestant for season 30 of the American series Dancing with the Stars. Chisholm was eliminated on 18 October 2021, becoming the fifth star in the series to be voted off and therefore finishing in eleventh place. On 26 October 2021, Chisholm performed ""2 Become 1"" as a duet with Chris Martin of Coldplay for the 8th Annual ""We Can Survive"" concert by Audacy, which was held at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles.

On 1 September 2021, the Spice Girls had announced the re-release of Spice to mark their anniversary, titling it Spice25. The deluxe, double album was released on 29 October 2021 and contained remixes, demos and unreleased tracks. The CDs come in an A5 hardback booklet, with a collection of iconic images and a set of six Spice Girls postcards, while the original album is also available on limited edition vinyl and cassette. In an interview with Apple Music for the Spice25 release, Chisholm divulged, “We had [a] risqué song called ‘C U Next Tuesday’, which was vetoed for the 25th anniversary edition, but I do have plans for it. It sounds like a Lily Allen song; it’s absolutely brilliant.” The deluxe release saw the album reenter the UK Albums Chart at number 5, number 3 on the UK Official Vinyl Albums Chart Top 40 and number 4 on the UK Official Physical Albums Chart.","

Katie Melua,"Ketevan Melua was born on 16 September 1984 to Amiran and Tamara Melua in Kutaisi, Georgia, which was then part of the Soviet Union. She spent her first years with her grandparents in Tbilisi before moving with her parents and brother to the town of Batumi, where her father worked as a heart specialist. During this time, Melua sometimes had to carry buckets of water up five flights of stairs to her family's flat and according to her, ""Now, when I'm staying in luxurious hotels, I think back to those days"".

In 1993, when Melua was eight, the family moved to Belfast, Northern Ireland, in the aftermath of the Georgian Civil War. Her father, a heart surgeon, took up a position at the Royal Victoria Hospital. The family remained in Belfast, living close to Falls Road, until Melua was 14. During her time in Northern Ireland, Melua attended St Catherine's Primary School on the Falls Road and later moved to Dominican College, Fortwilliam.

The Melua family then moved to Sutton, London and some time later moved again to Redhill, Surrey. In 2008, Melua moved out of her parents' home in Maida Vale to an apartment in Notting Hill, where she transformed the spare bedroom into a recording studio. Melua is fluent in English and speaks some Russian; despite still speaking her native Georgian fluently she has admitted that she cannot write songs in the language. Melua is also partly of Canadian and Russian ancestry.

Melua was baptised into the Georgian Orthodox Church. When living in Belfast, Melua attended the Roman Catholic schools St Catherine's Primary School and Dominican College, Fortwilliam, while her younger brother attended State schools. After completing her GCSEs at the all-girls' grammar school Nonsuch High School in Cheam, Sutton, Melua attended the BRIT School for the Performing Arts in the London Borough of Croydon, undertaking a BTEC with an A-level in music.

Melua has not attended university, though she has often stated her desire to do so, saying that English literature, history and physics would be her courses of choice should she have the chance to go to university.","After an upbringing in politically unstable Georgia, Melua initially planned to become either a historian or a politician. This changed in 2000, at the age of 15, when Melua took part in a talent competition on British television channel ITV called ""Stars Up Their Noses"" (a spoof of Stars in Their Eyes) as part of the children's programme Mad for It. Melua won the contest by singing Badfinger's ""Without You"". The prize was £350 worth of MFI vouchers, with which she bought a chair for her father. Had she lost the contest, she would have been gunged.After completing her GCSEs, Melua attended the BRIT School for the Performing Arts in the London Borough of Croydon, undertaking a BTEC with an A-level in music. When studying at the school, Melua began to write songs and met her future manager and producer, Mike Batt.

While performing at BRIT School showcase, Melua caught the eye of songwriter and producer Mike Batt. Batt was originally looking for an acid-rock band, bass player and a singer capable of singing ""jazz and blues in an interesting way"". After hearing Melua sing ""Faraway Voice"" (a song she wrote about the death of her idol Eva Cassidy) Batt signed the 18-year-old Melua to his small Dramatico recording and management company and took her into the studio, producing her first three albums during the subsequent years, plus her fifth and sixth albums.For her fourth album, The House (2010), Melua worked with producer William Orbit. She said about the experience: ""The whole thing has been really exciting. It was the same feeling I had the first time I went skydiving. I was really quite nervous, but I knew all I had to do was let myself go and it was going to feel amazing. I wasn't trying to get away from anything. It was more about going towards something. I wanted the music to be inspired by the future, something unknown that's never been heard before, but at the same time hold on to the values of the music of the past, to try and tap into something that's so ancient and old that it's kind of forgotten. I thought that, if we went far enough in both directions, we could end up in the same place"".","

Alice Merton,"Merton was born on 13 September 1993 in Frankfurt, Germany to a German mother and an Irish-born father. Merton's family moved frequently due to her father's job as a mining consultant. When she was three months old, Merton moved to Connecticut. Shortly thereafter, they relocated to Oakville, Ontario, Canada where she was raised until the age of thirteen, learning classical piano and singing. Her family then relocated to Munich. Merton's return to Germany prompted her to learn German which enabled her to speak with her German grandmother whom she had only seen once annually growing up. While in Germany, Merton wrote her first song and attended a German-language high school before graduating and moving to England.

Merton moved frequently in her early life, living in Oakville, Ontario, Connecticut, New York, Munich, Bournemouth, London, and Berlin, among other cities. Through her upbringing, Merton has stated she has felt connected to Canada, England, Germany, and France where her mother lived. In 2013, she started her studies at the Popakademie Baden-Württemberg in Mannheim, where she earned a bachelor's degree in composition and song writing, and met the members of her future band.","Merton first drew major attention in 2015  as a songwriter and singer on Fahrenhaidt's album The Book of Nature. On 14 November 2016 while in Hamburg she won the annual award for the promotion of talented newcomers in the category Acoustic Pop.

After moving to Berlin, Alice and her manager Paul Grauwinkel founded the record label Paper Plane Records International, and released the song ""No Roots"" at the end of 2016. The song's lyrics were inspired by her feeling of ""There's no one place where my home is."" On both Hype Machine and Spotify's Global Viral 50 charts the song reached number one, and was soon included on the ""Hit Play"" lists of several radio stations. The song was also featured on episode 5x09 of the NBC TV series, The Blacklist. On the basis of this success, Merton officially released her first EP, No Roots, on 3 February 2017. No Roots reached number one on the French charts, number two on the German charts, number three in Austria, number 25 in Switzerland and number one in US alternative radio charts. Vodafone Germany even included the song in one of its commercials. Alice signed with Mom + Pop Music in August 2017 for marketing within the United States, and on 2 August 2017 she released her second single Hit the Ground Running with her new record label.

She performed at the Life Ball in Vienna on 10 June 2017, and ended the year touring throughout Germany, appearing as opening act for Bosse and Philipp Poisel, among others. In late 2017 she won the 2018 European Border Breakers Award.On 7 September 2018, Merton released ""Why So Serious"", the lead single from her debut album, Mint. She released two other singles since then. The album was released on 18 January 2019. The second official single Funny Business was released 30 November.

Merton dueted with British singer-songwriter Tom Odell in the single ""Half As Good As You"" that was released on 28 September 2018.

On 1 February 2019, Merton released the first part of the Making of Mint documentary and announced an April 2019 USA concert tour. In 2019, Merton was a coach on ninth series of The Voice of Germany, and became the first female coach to win a series with Claudia Emmanuela Santoso.

On 18 October 2019, Merton released her album Mint again with four additional songs (Back To Berlin, PCH, Easy and Keeps Me Awake). Later, in the beginning of 2020, she toured across Germany, Austria, Czech Republic and Denmark singing these new songs, as well as the ones from her previous album.On 8 April 2021, Merton released ""Vertigo"".

MiChi,"Michiko was born in Bromsgrove, England to a Japanese mother and an English father. She moved to Kobe, Japan at the age of two in 1987, but returned to England in 1995 after the Great Hanshin earthquake. Determined to be a singer, she performed in an acoustic duo before returning to Japan when she was 18. The following year, she met Tomokazu Matsuzawa, producer for acts such as Mika Nakashima, Miliyah Kato, Soulhead, and Chemistry. The pair worked together for three years developing her talent before MiChi entered Japan's dance club scene. In March 2007, she released the track ""Surrender"" on a dance compilation titled Freedom House Mode Collection. It was followed a year later with her independently released English language album Michi Madness, which entered the Japanese Oricon weekly albums chart, but only peaked at number 148.Later in 2008 she officially debut under Sony Music Entertainment and produced her first single titled ""Promise,"" peaking at number 12 on the Oricon weekly charts. Her second single, titled ""Change the World,"" was released on 18 February 2009 and was used in the drama Kiina: Fukanō Hanzaisōsa-kan.

On 30 September 2009, MiChi released her debut major album Up to You, which was successful and peaked at number 4 on the Oricon weekly album chart. Her song ""Something Missing"" was used as the theme song in the Sega video game Bayonetta, as well as for commercials promoting the game.In April 2010, she released the single ""All About the Girls (Ii jan ka Party People)/Together Again"". ""Together Again"" was used as the theme song for the movie Bushido Sixteen directed by Tomoyuki Furumaya. The music video for ""All About The Girls"", which features a mix of stop motion, studio and computer generated footage was produced in collaboration with Tokyo dance-troupe Handsome Boyz. In July 2010, she released ""Wonder Woman,"" featuring the Japanese indie band The Telephones. MiChi's final 2010 release was her first Japanese language EP, Love Is. Released due to the delay of her second studio album, the album features four previously unreleased recordings, including three original songs, and a cover of The Offspring's ""Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)."" The title track from the EP received a stop motion music video, filmed from back to front.

In response to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, MiChi released online the demo of ""One,"" a song she had been working on. The song, featuring emotional and supportive lyrics, received heavy radio rotation in the days and weeks following the disaster. This led to her label allowing MiChi to finish the song, and release it as an official single. It eventually peaked at 85 on the Oricon charts. Later in 2011, MiChi released her eighth single, ""Find Your Way."" It charted at number 93, selling just 674 copies, despite a high-profile promotional appearance at the MTV VMAJ awards. On 1 February 2012, MiChi released her ninth single, ""Tokyo Nights"" featuring Swedish-Japanese indie musician, Leo Imai. The music video, which shows MiChi in various locations throughout Tokyo, including at the Tokyo Tower, was released shortly before the single hit shelves.

During Milo's childhood she tried to surround herself with inspiring people, Milo started singing with local musicians and arts collectives when she was 14. ""There was so little of that where I lived; an area which gave little hope to anyone, it's almost like they were told that they had a crappy fate and were willing to just go along with it."" Milo went to Harris Academy South Norwood until the end of year 9 when she went on to study Musical Theatre at the BRIT School.","Milo began surfing the internet for jazz-inspired hip-hop beats she could sing over, whilst surfing the internet she came across a beat by producer BLCK RSSN.

Mitra appeared as the live-action model for Lara Croft, the lead character in Eidos Interactive's Tomb Raider video game series before Angelina Jolie took the role for the two Tomb Raider films (2001–2003). Mitra was ranked No. 46 on the Maxim Hot 100 Women of 2001. She played the romantic interest of Christopher Lambert in Beowulf. Her first main role came as Scott Wolf's illicit love interest on Party of Five. In 2000, Mitra had a small role in the film Hollow Man as a neighbour sexually assaulted by Kevin Bacon's character.

Rae Morris,"Morris was born in Blackpool, Lancashire, England, and started playing the piano when she was four years old. She attended St. George's School and then studied A-levels in music and drama at Cardinal Newman College in Preston, Lancashire. She worked as a waitress at the grounds of Blackpool F.C..","Morris gigged in Blackpool and around the North-West England during her college studies. She attracted the attention of BBC Radio Lancashire presenter Sean McGinty, who put her forward to perform on the BBC Introducing stage at the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2011. She was signed to Universal Music Publishing Group the same month and to Atlantic Records in September 2011. Morris had received attention from other labels but chose Atlantic because they ""would take it slow"" and ""didn't blow any smoke up my arse"".

During this period she was mentored by fellow Blackpool singer-songwriter Karima Francis, who helped develop her songwriting skills. She was also in a two-year relationship with Francis, which she said inspired the songs on her debut album ""about going through that, exploring that sexuality and those feelings for the first time. Then coming out the other side of that as well, so that's the album"".Morris released her debut single in March 2012, ""Don't Go"", following its use in the final episode of the sixth series of the television drama series Skins. She recorded an EP, For You, which she sold exclusively at her live performances in mid 2012, and in November released a second EP, Grow. Another EP, From Above, followed in 2013. Alongside her solo gigs during 2012 and 2013, Morris was a support act for artists including Bombay Bicycle Club, Lianne La Havas, Noah and the Whale, and Tom Odell. She contributed guest vocals to three tracks on Bombay Bicycle Club's 2014 album So Long, See You Tomorrow, including the single ""Luna"". Also in 2014, Morris co-wrote and featured on the Clean Bandit song ""Up Again"" (from their debut album New Eyes). Rae Morris was recently the MarkMeets featured artist of the month December 2014 Rae also opened for George Ezra on his European tour, as well as embarking on her own headlining UK tour.During 2014, Morris released the singles ""Do You Even Know?"", ""Cold"" (featuring Fryars), and ""Closer""—each with accompanying EPs—to promote her debut album, Unguarded, which she recorded primarily in Los Angeles with producer Ariel Rechtshaid. Morris was longlisted in the BBC Sound of 2015 poll, and Unguarded was released in January 2015 alongside the single ""Under the Shadows"", with another headlining tour following in February. Unguarded, which also features production from Jim Eliot and Fryars, debuted at number nine on the UK Albums Chart.

Later in 2015, Morris appeared in a television advertisement for fashion retailer Boohoo that featured the album's fifth single, ""Love Again"". She featured on Sivu's single ""The Nile"" and performed at festivals including Bestival, Glastonbury, Lytham Festival, T in the Park, and Truck Festival. The sixth single from Unguarded, ""Don't Go"", was released in association with breast cancer awareness charity Coppafeel!.Morris began work on the follow up to Unguarded in late 2015. Touring to promote the album began in March 2017 and included a concert at Concorde 2 in Brighton supported by PAULi and Saskia Maxwell. In September a wider tour included Norwich, Nottingham, Salisbury Arts Centre, Leeds and Islington in London.

Working prominently with Fryars, Morris opted for a more electronic-oriented sound for her second album. Between July 2017 and October 2018, Morris released seven singles to promote the album - ""Reborn"", ""Do It"", ""Atletico (The Only One)"", ""Push Me to My Limit"", ""Lower the Tone"", ""Someone Out There"" and ""Dancing With Character"" - as well as various remixes. The album, titled Someone Out There, was released on 2 February 2018.

In July 2018, the song ""Reborn"" from Someone Out There was featured in the BBC's closing montage from the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

In October 2018, Morris said she was ""going away for a few months to write the next era.""

On 19 November 2018, Spice Girl Melanie C released ""High Heels"" feat. Sink the Pink, which was co-written with Morris.

On 4 June 2021, Morris released ""Fish n Chips"", a collaboration with TikTok star, grime artist, and fellow Blackpool native Soph Aspin.","Title—Details—Peak chart positions,Title—Details—Unguarded—* Released: 26 January 2015 * Label: Atlantic, Warner * Format: CD, digital download—9,Someone Out There—* Released: 2 February 2018 * Label: Atlantic, Warner * Format: CD, digital download—20,For You—* Released: 2012 * Label: Atlantic, Warner * Format: CD,Grow—* Released: 2012 * Label: Atlantic, Warner * Format: CD, Digital download,From Above—* Released: 19 April 2013 * Label: Atlantic, Warner * Format: Digital download,Do You Even Know?—* Released: 2014 * Label: Atlantic, Warner * Format: Digital download,Cold—* Released: 2014 * Label: Atlantic, Warner * Format: Digital download,Closer—* Released: 17 October 2014 * Label: Atlantic, Warner * Format: Digital download,Someone Out There, At The Piano—* Released: November 2019 * Label: self-released * Format: Vinyl (Limited Edition),Year—Title—2012—Album—""Don't Go""—Unguarded,""Grow""—2012—Unguarded,2013—""From Above""—Non-album single,2014—""Do You Even Know?""—Unguarded,2014—""Cold"" (featuring Fryars)—Unguarded,2014—""Closer""—Unguarded,2015—""Under the Shadows""—53—Unguarded,2015—""Love Again""—83—Unguarded,2017—""Reborn""—Someone Out There,2017—""Do It""—Someone Out There,2017—""Atletico (The Only One)""—Someone Out There,2018—""Push Me To My Limit""—Someone Out There,2018—""Lower The Tone""—Someone Out There,2018—""Someone Out There—Someone Out There,2018—""Dancing With Character""—Someone Out There,2021—""Fish n Chips"" (featuring Soph Aspin)—Non-album single,""—"" denotes a single that did not chart or was not released.,""Don't Go"" (live version)—2012—The Blind Club,""Grow""—2012—Bouha Kazmi,""Way Back When""—2013—The Blind Club,""From Above""—2013—James Slater,""Wait a While""—2013—The Blind Club,""Skin""—2014—Nadia Marquard Otzen,""Do You Even Know?""—2014—Nadia Marquard Otzen,""Cold"" (featuring Fryars)—2014—Nadia Marquard Otzen,""Closer""—2014—Zac Ella,""Under the Shadows""—2015—Alex Southam,""Love Again""—2015—Charlie Robins,""Don't Go""—2015—Louis Bhose,""Reborn""—2017—Noel Paul,""Do It""—2017—Noel Paul,""Atletico (The Only One)""—2017—Noel Paul,""Someone Out There""—2018—Noel Paul,""Dancing With Character""—2018—Noel Paul,""Fish n Chips"" (featuring Soph Aspin)—2021—Unknown,",N/A,an English singer and songwriter,2/8/1992,2011–present,Art pop music,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rae_Morris
Sarah Jane Morris (singer),"In 1982, Morris joined The Republic as lead singer. A London-based Afro-Caribbean-Latin band with leftish tendencies, they received enormous publicity from the music press including cover stories with NME and City Limits and a documentary for Granada TV. But the band was deemed too political for radio play, with the exception of Capital Radio. The Republic were signed to Charlie Gillett's Oval Records Ltd and released an EP entitled Three Songs From The Republic and two singles entitled ""One Chance"" and ""My Spies"". Success did not follow and the band split up in 1984.

Morris then sang with The Happy End, a 21-piece brass band named after Bertolt Brecht, Elisabeth Hauptmann and Kurt Weill's musical play. Playing a circuit that included Brighton's Zap Club and the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, The Happy End explored protest music from Africa, Ireland and Latin America on a way that emulated Charlie Haden's Liberation Music Orchestra.

Morris explored her more theatrical side on Brecht/Eisler's There's Nothing Quite Like Money and Brecht/Weill's Pirate Jenny from The Threepenny Opera.

The Happy End released two albums on the Cooking Vinyl label with Morris. Following a successful Edinburgh run in 1986, Morris then decamped to chart success with The Communards.

Morris found fame initially with the Communards, who are best known for their hit ""Don't Leave Me This Way"". Morris featured prominently on many Communards tracks, her low and deep vocal range contrasting with Jimmy Somerville's falsetto. She has also recorded as a solo artist, releasing albums since 1989. These have enjoyed most popularity in Italy and Greece.

Morris also contributed to the opera The Fall of the House of Usher (1991) by Peter Hammill and Judge Smith, singing the part of the chorus. She also sang the part of Mère Ubu on the Pere Ubu album Long Live Père Ubu! (2009), which features songs from Bring Me The Head of Pere Ubu, David Thomas's theatrical adaptation of Alfred Jarry's Ubu Roi.

She recorded an album of John Martyn covers with guitarist Tony Rémy in 2019 entitled Sweet Little Mystery and is touring with him playing the songs from the album.

Flo Morrissey,"Born in London to a large family with eight siblings, Flo Morrissey discovered an interest in folk music at an early age. She is the daughter of Helena, Baroness Morrissey, a former CEO of Newton Investment Management, and Richard, a Buddhist monk and former financial journalist. Morrissey began to write her own songs at the age of 14 and left school three years later, and gained a place at the BRIT School for Performing Arts and Technology where she studied music for two years. Deciding upon a career in music, after leaving the BRIT school, she commented, ""it has meant that I haven’t met many like-minded people, like I might have if I’d gone to university"". After releasing a video performing the song ""If You Can’t Love This All Goes Away,"" she was signed to Glassnote Records. The recording sessions for her debut album took place during the summer of 2014 in Los Angeles. In December 2014, Morrissey released the single ""Pages of Gold,"" to be followed in June 2015 by the album Tomorrow Will Be Beautiful, produced by Noah Georgeson and Philippe Zdar. Morrissey was featured on a number of festivals in 2015, including Glastonbury. In September, she moved to Paris while she toured Japan and North America and released the single ""Show Me"" in December 2015. On January 13, 2017, Morrissey released an album of covers with Matthew E. White entitled Gentlewoman, Ruby Man. It received four out of five stars from The Guardians Alexis Petridis.

Morrissey is married to British singer-songwriter Benjamin Clementine; the couple had their first child Julian Jupiter Richard Sainte-Clémentine on Florence's birthday, Christmas Day, 2017. A daughter, Helena Clementine, was born on 29 October 2019, in Ojai, California.

Alison Moyet,"Moyet was born Geneviève Alison Jane Moyet in the Essex town of Billericay to a French father and English mother. She grew up in the nearby town of Basildon, where she attended Janet Duke Junior School and then Nicholas Comprehensive at secondary level. After leaving school at 16, she worked as a shop assistant and trained as a piano tuner. She was involved in a number of punk rock, pub rock and blues bands in the South East Essex area during the late 1970s and early 1980s, including the Vandals, the Screamin' Ab Dabs, the Vicars and the Little Roosters (the latter featuring Garrie Lammin, formerly of Cock Sparrer).","At the age of 20, Moyet's mainstream pop career began in 1982 with the formation of the synthpop duo Yazoo with former Depeche Mode member Vince Clarke. In the United States, the band operated under the name Yaz, due to trademark issues with the Yazoo Records record label already operating in the region. Yazoo had several hits, including ""Only You"", ""Don't Go"", ""Situation"" and ""Nobody's Diary"", and recorded two albums, Upstairs at Eric's and You and Me Both.

In 1983, Clarke decided to disband Yazoo. While Clarke went on to form The Assembly (another duo, this time with Eric Radcliffe) and then Erasure (a duo again, with Andy Bell), Moyet signed to CBS, and began her solo career. In 1984, Moyet released her debut solo album Alf (titled after her punk-era nickname). Alf was produced by the record producing and songwriting team of Jolley & Swain. The album was co-written by the duo and Moyet, with the exception of ""Invisible"", which was written for Moyet by Lamont Dozier. The record was a hit in Britain, reaching No. 1 in the album chart. Alf spawned three international hit singles, ""Love Resurrection"" (UK No. 10), ""Invisible"" (UK No. 21) and ""All Cried Out"" (UK No. 8). In the US, ""Invisible"" was a Top 40 hit. In some European territories, a fourth single, ""For You Only"", was also released.

In 1985, Moyet performed at Live Aid alongside Paul Young and later returned unscheduled to the stage (alongside Bob Geldof, David Bowie and Pete Townshend) to provide vocals on ""Let It Be"" when Paul McCartney's vocal microphone at his piano failed, leaving him unable to be heard for the first stanza of the song. (Twenty years later, he overdubbed his vocal for the Live Aid DVD release.) Moyet also released a single not featured on Alf, a cover of the standard ""That Ole Devil Called Love"", which climbed to No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart (it remains Moyet's highest-charting UK single).

Moyet had another big UK hit the following year with ""Is This Love?"" (co-written by Eurythmics' Dave Stewart, under the pseudonym Jean Guiot), followed in 1987 by her second LP, Raindancing. Raindancing spawned further hit singles, including a cover of Floy Joy's ""Weak in the Presence of Beauty"" and ""Ordinary Girl"". In 1987, she scored another cover hit with ""Love Letters"", which peaked at UK No. 4. The video for the song featured comedy duo French & Saunders.Following a period of personal and career evaluation, she released Hoodoo in 1991. The album sold respectably in the UK, and Moyet was nominated for a Grammy for the single ""It Won't Be Long"". However, the release of Hoodoo marked the beginning of an eight-year fight for Moyet to secure complete control of her artistic direction. Like many similar artists (including Aimee Mann and the late Kirsty MacColl), Moyet was reluctant to record a radio-friendly ""pop"" album simply for the sake of creating chart hits.

Moyet's next album, Essex (1994), was also a source of controversy for her; in order for the album to be released, her label (now Sony) insisted that certain Essex tracks be re-recorded and re-produced, and that there be additional material remixed to create a more 'commercial' package. The video for the single ""Whispering Your Name"" again featured Dawn French.

Following the release of Essex, Sony released a greatest hits compilation of Moyet's work. Singles entered the UK charts at No. 1 and, following a UK tour, was re-issued as a double CD set which included ""Live (No Overdubs)"", a bonus live CD. Upon re-issue, Singles charted again, this time in the Top 20.

Due to prolonged litigation with Sony, Moyet did not record or release a new studio album for over eight years after the release of Essex. During this time, however, she recorded vocals for Tricky, Sylk-130, Ocean Colour Scene, The Lightning Seeds, and King Britt, and was featured on the British leg of the Lilith Fair tour. 2001 saw the release of The Essential Alison Moyet CD, and in 2002 The Essential Alison Moyet DVD.

In 1995, she sang back-up vocals with Sinéad O'Connor for one of Dusty Springfield's last television appearances, singing ""Where Is a Woman to Go?"" on the music show Later With Jools Holland.In August 2002, Moyet was released from her Sony contract. Moyet signed to Sanctuary Records and released her first studio album in eight years. Hometime was produced by The Insects, who had also produced works by Massive Attack and Madonna. The release of the CD launched Moyet into the top five best-selling female UK artists of 2002, and resulted in a BRIT Awards nomination for Best Female Vocalist, as well as a nomination for the Mercury Music Prize. Hometime was certified gold in the UK for sales in excess of 100,000 copies, with little promotion.

Voice, a collection of cover versions, was released on 6 September 2004 and entered the UK charts at No. 7. Scored and produced by Moyet's neighbour (and Academy Award winner) Anne Dudley, the album was later re-issued with a bonus track, ""Alfie"". A companion DVD, One Blue Voice, was released in 2006. Voice was certified Gold in the UK within four weeks of its release.

In December 2006, Moyet signed a recording contract with W14 Music, a Universal Music Group imprint. The deal saw Moyet reunited with label head John Williams, who was A&R man for her previous two albums, Hometime and Voice.

Moyet's album, The Turn, was released on 15 October 2007, preceded by the single ""One More Time"" a week earlier. The album featured self-penned songs, including the three numbers she wrote for the stage play, Smaller in which she starred with Dawn French. For these songs, again Moyet worked alongside producer/songwriter and frequent Moyet collaborator Pete Glenister. The Turn debuted at No. 21 on the UK Albums Chart on 22 October 2007. Moyet left W14 shortly after the release of The Turn. During mid-2008, Moyet reunited with Vince Clarke as Yazoo for a series of live dates.



Sony Music released The Best of Alison Moyet on 19 October 2009. It was Moyet's personal selection of tracks from her seven solo albums. The deluxe edition of the album, The Best of: 25 Years Revisited, contained an extra disc, with re-recorded versions of older songs. Moyet supported the release with a tour of the UK and Ireland during November and December 2009. Also in 2009, she provided vocals to My Robot Friend's single ""Waiting.""Moyet appeared with Jools Holland throughout his tour of the UK in 2010. In the same year she contributed vocals to ""The Man That Got Away"" on Holland's album Rocking Horse.

Moyet appeared with Heather Peace in January 2012 on the final concert of Peace's first studio album, Fairytales.

Moyet announced on BBC Radio 6 Music that her new album with Guy Sigsworth would be released in 2012, but in February that year she stated ""I appear to have forfeited my recording deal because I won't do reality TV. No-one needs to make an album that badly. Tea anyone?"" In an interview with Touchbase the following June, Moyet confirmed that she was still recording her album and that she was not rushing it. On 22 January 2013 the singer announced on her Facebook page that she had signed a worldwide deal with London-based record label Cooking Vinyl. Sony Music had earlier announced that Moyet's four solo albums on the label (Alf, Raindancing, Hoodoo and Essex) were being digitally remastered and would be reissued with B-sides and bonus material. In February 2013, Moyet said of the remastered albums: ""The project was Sony's – some initial work was done and then the project was suspended.""

The Minutes was released in the UK on 6 May 2013. The first single, ""When I Was Your Girl"", was released on 1 April 2013. A tour of the UK and Ireland to promote the album was announced for October. Describing the album, Moyet said: ""I avoided listening to anything during the process of writing and recording this album, choosing instead to be led by my own melodic voice, the one I now find myself with 30-years-in. Guy Sigsworth returns me to a programmer's world and marries it with perfect musicality. I have been waiting for him. We have made an album mindless of industry mores that apply to middle-aged women and have shunned all talk of audiences, demographics and advert jazz covers. This has easily been my happiest studio experience."" The Minutes debuted at number 5 on the UK Albums Chart, her highest debut since 1987's Raindancing.

In July 2013, Moyet said that she has begun writing new material for the follow-up to The Minutes.

On 16 October 2013, Moyet appeared as a guest performer on ITV 1's The One and Only Cilla Black celebrating Cilla Black's 50 years in show business. Moyet sang ""Anyone Who Had a Heart"".

On 10 November 2014, Moyet released a live album, Minutes and Seconds – Live, taken from The Minutes Tour.

On 30 July 2015, it was announced that Moyet would be releasing deluxe editions of her albums Hometime, Voice, and The Turn. According to her official web site: ""Each album will feature plenty of bonus material – including some rare and previously unreleased material.""

On 21 September 2015, Moyet performed at the Burberry Show at London Fashion Week. Her set was released as a digital EP, Live for Burberry on 23 September.

On 27 September 2016, it was announced that Moyet's first four studio albums Alf, Raindancing, Hoodooo and Essex would be reissued as Deluxe editions after having been remastered by BMG on 25 November 2016.

Mpho,N/A,"Mpho began working in the music industry in 2004, initially as a backing vocalist for artists such as Ms Dynamite, Natasha Bedingfield, Ty, Terri Walker, Skinnyman, Rodney P, and Spacek. She was a lead vocalist on the Bugz in the Attic single ""Booty La La"", which reached number 44 on the UK Singles Chart. She signed to the Arts Council-funded record label Documented Records and, in 2005, released her debut single, ""Comin' for Ya"", and the four-track EP Don't Like You.

By late 2006, Mpho had joined PIAS Recordings/Wall of Sound on the strength of Don't Like You, and was preparing an electro-influenced album titled To Spite My Face with producers including Spacek, dBridge, and Yan Murawski. She also sang on the track ""This Island Earth"" on Coldcut's 2006 album Sound Mirrors, and released a second solo single, ""What You Waiting For?"", the same year.

By 2009, sessions for the album — now titled Pop Art — had gone into a heavily pop music direction with producers such as Future Cut, Rick Nowels, Rob Davis, and Switch. As such, Mpho issued the mixtape Mpho & the Art of Pop in January 2009 with DJ Beware. To fund extensive promotion of the album Pop Art, Wall of Sound brokered Mpho a five-album deal with EMI's Parlophone subsidiary.

Mpho's first single on Parlophone, the Switch-produced ""Box N Locks"" (which samples Martha and the Muffins' ""Echo Beach""), was released in July 2009 and peaked at number 49 on the UK Singles Chart. Pop Art was scheduled to follow in October 2009, but following minimal airplay of second single ""See Me Now"" (featuring rapper Wale, the album was shelved. Mpho subsequently announced via Twitter that Parlophone had dropped her due to creative differences. Also in October, Mpho featured on the charity single ""I Got Soul"" with artists such as Frankmusik and VV Brown under the group name Young Soul Rebels; the single reached number ten in the UK, and proceeds went to War Child UK.

In 2010, Mpho opened a vintage tea shop in Brixton with her sister. In 2012, she performed a one-off gig at London's Tate Modern gallery as part of an event celebrating the South London Black Music Archive.","Track listing

Naomi (singer-songwriter),N/A,"Naomi began her pop music career at the age of fifteen when spotted by Bob Miller (Corinne Bailey Rae, Christine Collister) after hearing a song she wrote for her GCSE music at school called 'With You'. She signed to the independent label QG Records and was mentored by the former head of press at MCA Records and press at Polydor Records, Pete Bassett. Naomi came to prominence after the release of her first single 'With You' on 24 August 2012, for which she was featured on the front page of the Manchester Evening News, Oldham Advertiser, Oldham Evening Chronicle and then nationally on ITV Daybreak and featured on ITV Granada Reports. Naomi was subsequently featured in The Independent, The Times, Metro, The Huffington Post and The Guardian.

Numerous radio interviews followed, including BBC Radio Manchester on the Becky Want show with Justin Moorhouse and Salford City Radio where Naomi performed live and a large following was developing, especially in her home city of Manchester.

Her success led to interviews and articles in teen magazines such as Mizz, Shout, Bliss. and the music magazine Music Week, who described Naomi as a 'talented songwriter'.The producer John McLaughlin, who has had numerous number-one hits after working with bands such as Busted, 911 (UK band), Mark Owen, Westlife and the winning songwriting coach on BBC Fame Academy wanted to work with Naomi after seeing her on TV and describes how ""I just had to work with her"". McLaughlin produced her next single 'Miss Me' which was released on 3 March 2013 on Sunshine Boys Records.

Naomi was invited back to be interviewed and perform live in two one-hour specials at Salford City Radio.

Naomi was interviewed and performed live on BBC Radio Manchester on the Becky Want show with Amy Clowes who described her live performance on the show as ""Brilliant, absolutely brilliant"".

Naomi was again interviewed by Oldham Advertiser, Oldham Evening Chronicle and on ITV Granada Reports along with teachers and pupils at her school who took part in the video for Naomi's next release, 'Ask Me Why', again produced by McLaughlin.

As well as performing live on radio, Naomi has twice been invited to perform live for the Internet TV show Ont'Sofa and at a number of venues and festivals in the UK, including during the Manchester International Festival at the DryLive in Manchester on 5 July 2013 for Designer Magazine and the Hulme Party in the park festival on 22 June 2013.

Naomi also worked with Matt Dixon, former senior product manager at EMI Records and on her debut EP 'Another Day', produced by John McLaughlin, Dave Thomas Jr and Jud Mahoney released in October 2013.The success of her EP, 'Another Day' led to Naomi being offered a publishing and Sync deal with A&G songs and the song 'Start Again' from the EP being selected as the music for TalkTalk Business online, television and radio advertising campaign across the UK.

A UK tour of schools was undertaken, with Naomi performing songs from her debut EP to an estimated 15,000 children at over 41 concerts through the year. and performed live at various community radio stations, BBC Radio Sheffield and BBC Radio Manchester.

Kate Nash,"Kate Marie Nash was born in the London Borough of Harrow in London on 6 July 1987, the second of three daughters born to an English father and Irish mother. Her father, Steve, is a systems analyst, while her mother, Marie (née Walsh), was a hospice nurse. She learned to play the piano at an early age. At 18, she underwent cardiac radiofrequency ablation in order to eliminate tachycardia. The surgery subsequently inspired her song ""Death Proof"". She attended the BRIT School and originally wanted to study acting, but turned to music after she was rejected from several drama colleges and universities, including the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. Prior to finding success, she worked in a River Island shop and a Nando's restaurant.","Nash embarked on a musical career in 2005, when she started recording after falling down the stairs and breaking her foot, which left her homebound. She started performing live, holding her first shows in pubs, at open mic nights, and an anti-folk festival in Brighton. After several gigs, she uploaded her music to MySpace where she secured a manager and found exposure thanks to support from Lily Allen. Her debut single, featuring songs ""Caroline's a Victim"" and ""Birds"", was recorded and produced in Iceland by Valgeir Sigurðsson, and released through Moshi Moshi Records in February 2007. The release was limited to 2,000 copies and available only on 7-inch vinyl. Due to demand, another 1,000 copies were made and these also sold out. CD promo copies were produced for distribution to the press and DJs and are occasionally available for sale. The music video for ""Caroline's a Victim"" was directed by Kinga Burza and received airplay on MTV2. The song was then included on the CD Moshi Moshi Singles Compilation and the single's B-side, ""Birds"", later featured on Nash's debut album. Both tracks have also been released on digital music platforms.

In April 2007, Nash was signed to the Polydor offshoot Fiction Records and the following month made her official TV performance debut on Later... with Jools Holland. Her second single, ""Foundations"", which she co-wrote with producer Paul Epworth, was released by Fiction on 18 June 2007 and reached number two in the official UK Singles Chart. Following this success, the label announced plans to bring forward the release of Nash's debut album Made of Bricks to 6 August 2007. Produced by Paul Epworth, the album included many of the tracks she had been performing during her two nationwide tours. Made of Bricks was leaked to filesharing networks a few days before its official commercial release and subsequently received mixed reviews; The Independent described it as being in ""pole position for worst album of the year"", while a BBC review called it ""an album of surprising verve and variety"". It proved, however, to be commercially successful when it entered and peaked on the UK Albums Chart at number 1, and stayed in the chart for over forty consecutive weeks.

During mid-2007, Nash performed at numerous festivals, including the Wireless Festival, Bestival, Electric Gardens, Glastonbury, Latitude, Reading and Leeds, Oxegen and T in the Park. Throughout late 2007 and early 2008, she released three more singles from Made of Bricks. ""Mouthwash"" and ""Pumpkin Soup"" both made the Top 40 in the UK Singles Chart. Although her fifth single ""Merry Happy"" didn't chart well in the UK, the song enjoyed minor success in other countries, including the United States and Canada. Made of Bricks peaked at number 36 on the US Billboard 200 chart in January 2008. It would later be certified Platinum in the UK and Gold in Germany. In February 2008, Nash was honoured with the Best British Female Solo Artist award at the 2008 Brit Awards. She also won the Q Award for Breakthrough Artist and the NME Award for Best Solo Artist. Nash embarked on her first tour in Australia and the US in 2008 and opened the 2008 Glastonbury Festival.In March 2009, Nash became one of the founding members of Featured Artists' Coalition, a nonprofit organization and lobbying group, and revealed that she was in the early stages of recording her second album. She was introduced by her boyfriend Ryan Jarman to Bernard Butler, the producer of Duffy's debut album Rockferry and a former guitarist for Suede. The pair worked on eight songs at RAK Studios in the summer that year. As a side project in late 2009, Kate joined a punk band called The Receeders where she played bass guitar, with Jon Jackson and Brett Alaimo. In December, the band played a live gig at 93 Feet East.

In January 2010, Nash revealed that the album was complete, and the following month the song ""I Just Love You More"" was made available for free download from her official website. The first official single from the album was ""Do-Wah-Doo"", which was released on 12 April 2010 to a moderate chart success. Nash's second studio album My Best Friend Is You was released a week later and was met with generally positive reviews. The sound was described as having a girl group approach, influenced by a wide variety of genres, from Wall of Sound, Motown to no wave and riot grrrl. The album reached the top 10 on the charts in the UK and Germany, and met with moderate success elsewhere. Two further singles from the album, ""Kiss That Grrrl"" and ""Later On"", were released in 2010, but failed to chart. To promote the record, the singer embarked on a tour, beginning with nine dates in North America in late April, with the all-female travelling festival Lilith Fair. Her opening act was Supercute!, a psychedelic pop teen girl trio from New York City. She also took part in the 2010 V Festival. In August Nash performed in Australia at Melbourne's Corner Hotel and Sydney's Metro Theatre. In February 2011, her concerts in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo were the first contact with her Brazilian fans. The singer declared the Rio show ""the best concert of her life"" and ""the happiest place she has ever been"".

After Fiction Records terminated her contract, Nash launched her own record label, Have 10p Records. Indie act Brigitte Aphrodite (who had toured with Kate on many occasions) was the first artist signed to the label and released the debut single ""I Dream Myself Awake"" in 2011. Nash also appeared in Supercute!'s music video ""Dumb Dumbs"" and helped to produce their first album which eventually could not be released due to the band's split-up. Later in 2011, she launched the Kate Nash's Rock 'n' Roll for Girls After School Music Club as a platform to inspire teenage girls to get into songwriting and making their own music, due to the shortage of female artists in the UK. On her UK tour that year, Nash promoted the initiative in schools such as the City of Portsmouth Girls' School, Woodchurch High School and John Madejski Academy.In February 2012, Nash wrote and recorded a song with some of the Occupy London protesters camping outside the St Paul's Cathedral, following workshops led by her and Sam Duckworth of Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly. She contributed the song ""My Chinchilla"" to the Nardwuar and The Evaporators' album Busy Doing Nothing!. She also collaborated with Brisbane-based band The Thin Kids which resulted in the single ""The Thin Kids Theme"" released on her label and wrote the song ""I Am Me"" with Willow Smith, which was released later in 2012.

In June 2012, Nash embarked on a 12-date Faster Pussycat Run Run Tour across the UK and released a new song, ""Under-Estimate the Girl"", for free on her website as an intro to her third studio album. The punk and grunge-influenced song, which Nash wrote, recorded and made a video for in under 24 hours, received mostly negative feedback. As a fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Kate staged a play based on the season six musical episode ""Once More, with Feeling"" at Hackney Picturehouse. In November, her EP Death Proof was released. She had a small role in Greetings from Tim Buckley, a film about Tim and Jeff Buckley, which premiered at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival. She also appeared in films Syrup and Powder Room, released the following year. She was featured on Watsky's song ""Hey, Asshole"" from his 2013 album Cardboard Castles. Kate's third full-length studio album, Girl Talk, was released on 4 March 2013 independently through Have 10p Records. It featured a heavier, rock and grunge-influenced sound, and was a noticeable departure from her first two indie pop albums. Lyrically, it drew a lot of influence from the riot grrrl movement and explored the themes of feminism and female empowerment. The album was financed through a crowdfunding campaign on PledgeMusic and recorded in Los Angeles. Girl Talk received mixed to positive reviews and was a minor commercial success. It was supported by singles ""3AM"", ""OMYGOD!"" and ""Fri-End?"", but none of them made an impact on the charts. Nash promoted the album by extensively touring Europe and the Americas. In late 2013, she released a Christmas EP Have Faith with Kate Nash This Christmas with The Tuts.

In 2014, Nash performed at the Coachella and Lollapalooza festivals, and released a new free single ""She Rules"" which was accompanied by a DIY music video filmed on a mobile phone. In the same year, she relocated to Los Angeles and set up Girl Gang, an online support and networking hub for the feminist community. She co-wrote the song ""Poison"" which was a UK number 3 hit for Rita Ora in 2015. Later that year, Nash discovered that her manager, Gary Marella, had been stealing large sums of money from her, which resulted in near-bankruptcy. To try to recover financially, she went on to work for the comics store Meltdown in Los Angeles and started selling her clothes as second hand. Nash pressed legal charges against Marella and he was eventually ordered to pay her back the stolen money.In 2016, Nash released a standalone single ""Good Summer"", followed by ""My Little Alien"" which was written about a dog she had adopted. In April 2017, she launched a Kickstarter campaign to finance a fourth studio album and released an EP, Agenda, promoted by the single ""Call Me"". She joined the cast of a Netflix series GLOW telling a fictionalized story of the 1980s women's professional wrestling promotion, the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling (GLOW), where she played Rhonda ""Britannica"" Richardson. The series premiered in June 2017 to a very positive reception and was renewed for further three seasons. In August she embarked on a UK tour to mark the 10th anniversary of her debut album.

Nash's fourth studio album, Yesterday Was Forever, was released independently on 30 March 2018, preceded by the singles ""Drink About You"" and ""Life in Pink"". It received mixed to positive reviews from critics, but was not a commercial success and failed to chart. To promote the album, Nash toured the United States, Canada and the UK. In September 2018, Kate Nash: Underestimate the Girl, a documentary film by Amy Goldstein, premiered at the LA Film Festival. It follows Kate as she writes her fourth album, and features appearances from Jarrad Kritzstein, Alicia Warrington, and Jeff Ellis, among others. The film was screened at the Pérez Art Museum in Miami and made its UK debut in June 2019 when it was screened at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre and released onto BBC iPlayer. Kate also appeared in a feature film Horrible Histories: The Movie – Rotten Romans and released two new singles in 2019: the grunge-inspired ""Trash"", in which she condemns environmental pollution, and the pop track ""Bad Lieutenant"".Nash featured in the 2020 British comedy horror series Truth Seekers. Following the COVID-19 pandemic and the cancellation of GLOW, she launched a Patreon page to connect with her fans more directly. Nash is currently working on her fifth studio album which is partially inspired by Irish traditional music. In May 2021, she released a new single, ""Misery"". In September 2021, she released the single “Horsie”. Nash confirmed that her upcoming fifth studio album will be released in May 2022 and titled Nine Sad Symphonies.","

Jesy Nelson,"Jessica Louise Nelson was born on 14 June 1991. She was raised in Romford, East London to parents John Nelson, a businessman, and Janis Nelson, a Police Community Support Officer. Her parents separated when she was five. She is the second youngest of four children with an older sister Jade, an older brother Jonathan and a younger brother Joseph.

Nelson attended Jo Richardson Community School and Abbs Cross Academy and Arts College in Hornchurch, London. She also attended the Sylvia Young and Yvonne Rhodes Theatre Schools. Prior to auditioning for The X Factor, Nelson worked as a barmaid in Dagenham. In 2020, Nelson said that as a child, she had small roles as an extra in About a Boy (2002) and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005).","Her first audition was ""Bust Your Windows"" by Jazmine Sullivan, and successfully auditioned as a soloist for the eighth series of the UK version of The X Factor in front of judges Louis Walsh, Gary Barlow, Tulisa Contostavlos and Kelly Rowland, but failed the first challenge of the ""bootcamp"" section to progress through to the Girls category (solo females aged 16–24). Nelson and Perrie Edwards were put in a group called ""Faux Pas"" while Jade Thirlwall and Leigh-Anne Pinnock were to be put in a group named ""Orion"". Both groups, however, failed to progress. Both groups failed to make it through to the next stage. A later decision by the judges recalled two members from each group to form the four-piece group Rhythmix, sending them through to the ""judges' houses"" section. They eventually reached the live shows and were mentored by Tulisa Contostavlos. On 28 October 2011, it was announced that the band's new name would be Little Mix. On 11 December 2011, Little Mix were announced as the winners, making them the first band ever to win the show.

After winning the show, Little Mix signed a record deal with Syco Music, owned by Simon Cowell. Since joining Little Mix, Nelson has faced cyber-bullying and struggled to cope during her time on The X Factor. Nelson released six albums with the group; DNA (2012), Salute (2013), Get Weird (2015), Glory Days (2016), LM5 (2018) and Confetti (2020) The last of which was released a month before she left the group. In December 2020, she announced her departure from the group due to prolonged issues with her mental health. She said: ""I find the constant pressure of being in a girl group and living up to expectations very hard."" In May 2021, she announced that she had signed a record deal with Polydor Records and that she is releasing solo music later in the year.

Rebecca Newman,"Newman was born and raised in Exmouth, Devon, where she remained until she was 21. She began singing at the age of 13 and twice during her teenage years won a place with the National Youth Music Theatre. In 2002 she moved to London to pursue a career in business, and then moved to York, North Yorkshire in 2004, to read Philosophy, Politics and Economics at the University of York, graduating in 2007.

She went on to release four more studio albums selling over 15,000 copies before her debut chart-eligible album release in 2014. She also performed at many prestigious venues including Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, The Royal Hall in Harrogate and Headingley Stadium. In 2013, Newman performed with Aled Jones at Truro Cathedral and Russell Watson at the Party in the Park in Burton Agnes, and performed the national anthems live on international television for three Rugby League World Cup matches. Newman also co-wrote and recorded the official song for the Rugby League World Cup Dance Project, Pass It On.

Over the years, Newman built up a loyal following of supporters, who dub themselves The Newmaneers.In early 2013 she engaged the services of the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra, conductor and arranger Paul Bateman, orchestral producer James Fitzpatrick and producer Gareth Ellis Williams to help create her new album. The title track, Dare to Dream, was co-written by Newman, Chris Nicolaides and Mike Brayn. The album was released on her own record label, Rambling Rose Records, on 14 September 2014 and it went straight to number one in the Official UK Classical Artists Albums Chart. It received rave reviews and quickly sold out online and in HMV stores Following the chart success, Newman embarked on a fifty-plus date tour with Russell Watson, as his special guest, performing to over 50,000 people from March to July 2015, followed by a duet with tenor Alfie Boe during the final concert of his summer tour.","

Scout Niblett,"Niblett seldom discusses her personal life. Apart from her career in music, she has an obsessive interest in astrology and is also a professional astrologer. ""My dad bought me a book about astrology when I was about seven and I literally haven't stopped studying it since,"" she said. Themes and references to planets occasionally appear in Niblett's lyrics, and she explained the naming of her third album, Kidnapped by Neptune: ""The reason that album was called Kidnapped by Neptune was because Neptune was what they call 'transiting my ascendant' at the time and it literally did feel like I didn't know who I was. The energies of Neptune are dissolving your ego and it really kind of shakes you up. Right now Pluto, but also Uranus are equally battling, challenging my Sun."" She also is said to use astrology to predict the best place and time to record her music.","Niblett began performing at clubs in Nottingham while attending college. She chose her stage name in honour of Jean Louise ""Scout"" Finch, the protagonist in Harper Lee's 1960 novel To Kill a Mockingbird.

After sending out her EP demo CD ""Alene Had It All"" (recorded under the name Lion, and accompanied by drummer Kristian Godard), consisting of vocals, guitar, and drums, to multiple record companies, Niblett was approached by Secretly Canadian, who had been given her demos by Jason Molina of Songs: Ohia. The following year, Niblett released a 7"" split-single with Songs: Ohia, contributing the track ""Miss My Lion"". Niblett followed the single with her debut album, Sweet Heart Fever, released by Secretly Canadian in 2001, which she recorded at Chem Nineteen Recordings in Hamilton, Scotland with producer Andy Miller.

Her follow-up release was a one-sided 10"" EP, I Conjure Series, recorded live, where Niblett plays all the instruments herself.

Niblett relocated to the United States in 2003 to continue pursuing a music career, saying: ""The underground music culture in America is big enough so that you can make a living from it without being super famous. The mainstream culture of music [in England] is so different, because it's all based on selling things... In America you don't have to enter into that, you can still survive. You don't have to be in the industry there and you do [in England], so I had to leave"". She has resided in Portland, Oregon since 2005.In 2010, Niblett released her fifth studio album, The Calcination of Scout Niblett, marking her debut release with Drag City. The album received positive critical reviews from Pitchfork and Spin, who noted: ""[Niblett's] minimal songs – just one guitar and sporadic drums – unfold laboriously, as though forcing themselves from Niblett's clenched mouth and hands."" Niblett followed this with a single, No More Nasty Scrubs, in 2012, which featured covers of TLC's ""No Scrubs"" and ""Nasty"" by Janet Jackson. Her sixth studio album, It's Up to Emma, which she recorded in Portland, Oregon, and mixed the record herself. It was released on 21 May 2013 also on Drag City, and received positive critical acclaim from Pitchfork, Allmusic, and NME.","

Erica Nockalls,"Erica Nockalls was born in Rotherham, England and studied classical violin from the age of 7. She was offered a placement at Chetham's School of Music at age 9, but only attended for one week, deciding that the school was not for her.

At age 11, Nockalls moved with her family to the Isle of Axholme, North Lincolnshire, where she attended South Axholme Comprehensive School. By age 15 she had passed the Associated Board grade 8 violin exam with distinction, and by age 16 was the leader of the Beechfield Youth Orchestra. Throughout her teens Nockalls played in rock bands with school friends, and played locally as an electric violinist in rock cover bands. Nockalls also taught herself to play piano, guitar, and bass guitar during this time.

She went on to study A-level music, music technology, and media at John Leggott Sixth Form College in Scunthorpe, before successfully auditioning for a place to study violin at Birmingham Conservatoire, aged 19.","Nockalls accepted an entrance scholarship to study violin performance and voice at Birmingham Conservatoire.

""""It took me until I was 27 to feel I was ready to write my solo album, and as the mission statement explains in the Imminent Room artwork, I was bored of hearing and being disappointed by the efforts of almost everybody else, so I thought I'd invent my own music and stop moaning about it. It's not like I'm a good little classically trained violinist turned bad – I've always been like this, it's just now it's coming out.""""

Hayley Oliver,"The youngest of five girls, Hayley was born in South London. Her musical influences, growing up, were in the country world, listening to Dolly Parton, Emmylou Harris, Tammy Wynette and other traditional country music that her parents played. At the age of eleven, she was nominated to sing solo at the Royal Albert Hall (at that time, the youngest ever solo performer there) and this led to her making her first record (""Saint of the Orphans""), and subsequent television appearances on The Wide Awake Club and Going Live. Her success at such an early age made her want to have a career in music, but she first chose to finish her formal education. She studied at Linden Lodge School, the Royal National College for the Blind in Hereford, taking diplomas in business administration, and then went on to study at the University of Glamorgan, gaining a BA honours degree in Business & Marketing.

In 2002, Hayley entered and won the Joe Pasquale's Curtain Call talent showcase, which has led to many other concert appearances since.

In 2006, Hayley released her first self-produced album, Two Hearts. Drawing favourable reviews, it led to her winning the Evy of Canada Award for Best New Artist 2007.

During 2008 and 2009, she collaborated with USA Nashville producers, resulting in her second solo album, I Can Still Dream, released in October 2009, with original material provided by various writers from across the world. During those years, Hayley performed regularly with various artists and bands.

In 2008, she met up with guitarist Lee Ellis who joined her in forming ""The Hayley Oliver Band"", to run alongside her solo career. This resulted in the release in 2010 of Naturally. Recorded in two days at Ten21 studios in Kent, the album reflected the band's live sound.

Hayley and the band were invited to go to Nashville in November 2010, where they represented the UK, taking part in a WSM Radio event, which put on an international show of six country acts at the Loveless Café. The show was broadcast live in HD via the Internet. They returned to Nashville again in 2011 and played at the Nashville Palace.

In late 2012, the band released Arbinger Grove, with guest appearances by Albert Lee, Gerry Hogan and John Permenter. The album was critically acclaimed as being of international standard.

By 2014, conflicting commitments led to Hayley and the band members' decision to disband. After their successful last show at the 2014 Truckstop Festival in Denmark, Hayley decided to focus on a slightly different path, involving guitarist, Harley Dave, with a more ""rootsy"" Americana approach, rather than the full-on sound that was the trademark of the ""H.O.B."".

The ""unplugged"" approach proved a success, both in small ""roots"" venues and larger theatres. In 2015, Oliver unveiled her new band line-up on the main stage at the Americana International Festival, gaining rave reviews, and started taking select bookings, while continuing to develop the acoustic show. In 2016, after a short spell in Texas with Harley Dave, playing acoustic gigs in Austin and being welcomed into the Luckenbach ""Picker's Circle"", Oliver returned to the Truckstop Festival, Denmark, with the new band.

In 2017, Hayley and Harley guested with The Fabulous Texadillos at Pullman City Harz, Germany, and hope to take the band back to Germany, one day.

2018 and early 2019 saw Hayley and the band playing Warners, Pontins and some independent Country Music events, rather than the clubs.

2019-2020 brought things to a halt, as far as gigging was concerned - so Hayley decided to dust off her guitar and get back into playing it, which resulted in her fronting the band with her guitar when the restrictions were relaxed and gigs started up again in July, 2021, at Studley Castle (Warners).",N/A,N/A,"

Rita Ora,"Ora was born in Pristina, SFR Yugoslavia (present-day Kosovo), to Albanian parents. Her mother, Vera, is a psychiatrist and her father, Besnik Sahatçiu, is a pub owner, having previously studied economics. Ora has an older sister, Elena, and a younger brother, Don. She was born as Rita Sahatçiu (surname derived from the Turkish word saatçi, which means ""watchmaker""), but her parents later added Ora (which means ""time"" in Albanian) to the family surname so it could be easily pronounced.

Her family left Kosovo for political reasons, because of the persecution of Albanians initiated by the disintegration of Yugoslavia. They relocated to London, England in 1991, when she was a baby. She grew up in Notting Hill, in West London, and attended a performing arts school, Sylvia Young Theatre School.","Ora began performing at open mic sessions around London and, occasionally, in her father's pub. In 2008, she auditioned for Eurovision: Your Country Needs You on BBC One to be the British contestant for the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 and qualified, but later withdrew from the competition after a few episodes as she ""did not feel ready"" and thought ""that challenge wasn't for her."" Her manager, Sarah Stennett (who also worked with Ellie Goulding, Jessie J and Conor Maynard), later told HitQuarters that she reassured Ora that performing in Eurovision would hinder, rather than help her chances to make it as a solo artist.

Shortly after, Ora's management got in touch with the American label, Roc Nation, and told them about her. Ora signed a recording deal and a publishing deal with Roc Nation in December 2008, and was one of their first signees. She made cameo appearances in Jay Z's video for ""Young Forever"" (2009) and Drake's video, ""Over"" (2010). After being signed, Ora recorded an album and wanted to release it, but her label advised against it and she started to work on other material for her debut album.Throughout 2011, Ora released covers and videos about working on her debut album on YouTube. The videos caught the attention of DJ Fresh, who at that time was looking for a female vocalist for his song, ""Hot Right Now"". Ora featured on the single that was released on 12 February 2012, debuting at number one on the UK Singles Chart. During February 2012, Ora was also the opening act at the UK concerts from Drake's Club Paradise Tour.

The first UK single from her debut album, ""R.I.P."" (featuring Tinie Tempah), was released on 6 May 2012. Produced by Chase & Status, the song debuted at the top of the UK Singles Chart, becoming her first solo UK number one. On 12 August 2012, ""How We Do (Party)"" was released, and it reached number one in the UK and Ireland. It was Ora's second UK number one as a solo artist, and third overall in 2012.

Whilst supporting Coldplay on their Mylo Xyloto Tour, she later announced that her debut album would be titled Ora. The album was released on 27 August 2012 in Europe and Oceania, and debuted at the top of the UK Albums Chart. Ora was nominated for Best New Artist, Push Artist and Best UK/Ireland Act at the 2012 MTV Europe Music Awards. In September 2012, it was announced that Ora will be the opening act on the UK concerts from Usher's Euphoria Tour set to start in January 2013. Eventually, the tour was postponed due to Usher's ""professional and personal commitments."" From 23 October through to 30 October 2012, Ora embarked on her first headlining tour, Ora Tour, a mini-concert US tour.

""Shine Ya Light"", released on 4 November, became Ora's fourth consecutive UK top ten single in 2012, peaking at number ten. On 28 November 2012, Ora performed as a special guest at the concert held in Tirana, Albania for the 100th Anniversary of the Independence of Albania. Ora embarked on her first UK tour, ""Radioactive Tour"", in January 2013, to support her debut album. She was nominated for three awards at the 2013 Brit Awards, including the Brit Award for British Breakthrough Act.In January 2013, Ora revealed that her second album would be clearer and have more direction than the first one. On 26 February 2013, she revealed to Digital Spy that her second album shows a different angle to a ""party girl."" On 24 May 2013, Ora was the headline act on in New Music We Trust stage at BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend. On 28 June 2013, she performed on the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury.

In 2014, she had two top-five UK singles; the song ""I Will Never Let You Down"" which debuted at number one, and she featured on Iggy Azalea's ""Black Widow"" which peaked at number four in the UK, and the latter became Ora's first top ten song on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, peaking at number three. On 14 December 2014, Ora performed at the 2014 telecast of Christmas in Washington, filmed at the National Building Museum. In January 2015, Ora featured on Charli XCX song, ""Doing It"", from her second studio album. On 22 February 2015, at the 87th Academy Awards, she performed the song ""Grateful"", which appears in the film Beyond the Lights.

In December 2015, Ora filed a lawsuit against Roc Nation, seeking release from the label and citing that the contract she signed in 2008 is ""unenforceable"", due to California's ""seven-year rule."" The complaint stated that she's ""only been permitted to release one album despite creating multiple additional records for release"" and that her relationship with Roc Nation is ""irrevocably damaged."" In January 2016, Roc Nation filed a counter-lawsuit against Ora for breaking her recording contract, in New York. They reached a settlement in May 2016.

In June 2016, it was reported that she signed a new record deal with Atlantic Records and Warner Music Group. On 3 September 2016, she performed in a concert at the Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls, in Rome, at the vigil for Mother Teresa's canonisation, alongside other Albanian artists, accompanied by the Kosovo Philharmonic Orchestra.On 26 May 2017, Ora released her first solo single in almost two years, titled ""Your Song"", which peaked at number seven in the UK. The song served as the lead single from Ora's second studio album, after previous attempts at her second record were lost in her lawsuit against her former label, Roc Nation. The second single, ""Anywhere"", became her eleventh top ten song in the UK, peaking at number two. In January 2018, Ora released the song ""For You"" (with Liam Payne), from the soundtrack of the film Fifty Shades Freed.

On 18 September 2018, Ora revealed the title of her second studio album, Phoenix, and its release date, 23 November. On 21 September, she released the album's fourth single, ""Let You Love Me"". The song reached number four in the UK, marking Ora's 13th top-ten song, thus breaking a 30-year-old record for most top ten songs by a British female solo artist (previously jointly held by Shirley Bassey and Petula Clark). On 29 October, she announced tour dates for the album in Europe, Asia and Oceania from 1 March until 29 May 2019.In April 2019, Ora released the song ""Carry On"" with Norwegian producer Kygo, as a standalone single for Pokémon: Detective Pikachu, a film in which she also briefly appears. On 31 May, she released the song ""Ritual"", with Tiësto and Jonas Blue.

In September 2019, Ora confirmed to Marie Claire that she had begun working on her third studio album. She provided further details regarding her upcoming third studio album with NME, stating that ""people have been coming to studio sessions from all over the world. I've been working on this now for the past two years, on and off. I have plans for this third album to be something I've never done before.""

On 12 February 2021, Ora released the EP Bang, with Kazakh producer Imanbek.","

Aimee Osbourne,Osbourne's maternal grandfather was the English music manager Don Arden (Harry Levy). She is of partial Jewish descent.,"In 1991, Osbourne appeared as a child in some videos and documentaries relating to her father's musical career, and appeared on The Howard Stern Show in 1998, but did not reach mainstream acting success until being cast in MTV's 2003 adaptation of Wuthering Heights. She later provided voiceover work in the 2014 animated film Postman Pat: The Movie.

Around 2010, she began recording and releasing music under the project name ARO (her initials). ARO, in contrast to her father's heavy metal, has been described as synth pop, and is influenced by Kate Bush and Portishead, as well as PJ Harvey and Massive Attack. She has appeared in her own music videos, and her video for ""Raining Gold"" received two million hits in just two months.

ARO so far have performed only three live shows. Union Pool, Brooklyn on 1 April 2015, Mercury Lounge, New York City, on 2 April 2015 and The Echo, Los Angeles, on February 9, 2016.

In 2016, after releasing three songs ""Raining Gold"", ""I Can Change"" and ""Cocaine Style"", updates on the project started to become few and far between. On 17 October 2018 ARO announced on their official Instagram page that an EP was in the works thanking the fans for their patience. ARO teased new material on Instagram on 5 December 2018 with a snippet of a song called ""Beats of My Heart"". As of 2020 neither the EP or the single have been released and no new updates regarding the band had been released which suggests the band was either on hiatus or broken up.

On 13 February 2020, ARO posted their first update in over a year stating ""Thank you all so much for your interest. Not long to go now"". The post also revealed the debut album will be released on indie record label ""Makerecords"". On 24 July 2020, ARO released their first single in four years ""Shared Something With the Night"". Osbourne revealed the title of ARO's upcoming LP to be Vacare Adamaré and that they plan to release it in ""EP-like chapters, built around videos for each song"". Speaking of upcoming live shows she stated: ""I want the live show to feel like you’re on the haunted mansion ride at Disneyland, with a little Studio 54, a touch of vaudeville and a lot of Blade Runner. It will be ghostly and poetic with some neon and hypnotic laser lights to captivate all the senses.""","Studio albums

Kelly Osbourne,"Osbourne was born in Westminster, London. She has an elder sister, Aimee, and a younger brother, Jack. From Ozzy's first marriage, she also has two half-siblings: Jessica Hobbs and Louis John Osbourne. She had an unofficially ""adopted"" brother, Robert Marcato, whom Sharon and Ozzy took in after Marcato's mother died. Kelly grew up travelling with her father as he went on tour, and lived in more than 20 homes, mostly in the US, as well as in the UK. Her maternal grandfather was Don Arden (Harry Levy), an English music manager. Her mother is of Irish and Jewish descent.

Osbourne attended private schools in England including the girls school Pipers Corner school.","Osbourne and the rest of her family (without Aimee) starred on the MTV reality show The Osbournes, which aired from 2002 to 2005. The series chronicled their day-to-day life, portraying a dysfunctional family in which metal music, profanity and other harshness were a daily part of life. Kelly, the middle child, emerged (according to Rolling Stone) as ""a wickedly funny, brutally honest, pint-size, potty-mouthed spitfire."" The series started when she was seventeen, and ended when she was twenty. Kelly said in an interview for The Osbournes DVD that the crew were only actually supposed to be there for a few weeks but ended up staying for a few months and that the constant cameras focusing on her and her family was stressful. In 2002, during the second season of The Osbournes, Kelly dated The Used lead singer Bert McCracken. The show was filmed in California, where the family has had their residence for several decades.

Both she and the Osbourne family were parodied in Channel 4 comedy Bo' Selecta in which the rubber-masked Kelly, played by Leigh Francis, has her own show and is always being censored for swearing with bleeps.

After her appearance on the reality show, Osbourne quickly began to be noted for her varied and trendy style among fashion commentators like Steven Cojocaru. In 2004, Osbourne launched her own fashion line, Stiletto Killers, with her friend and former sponsor, Ali Barone. Stiletto Killers was a rock-inspired line of tees, knickers, hoodies and sweatpants designed by Osbourne and Barone, emblazoned with cartoonish designs and punk rock phrases. There was also a more sophisticated couture branch, the SK Collection. Stiletto Killers closed in April 2006.

Her debut album, Shut Up, was released by Epic Records in 2002 to moderate American sales, but good European sales. The lead single, a cover of Madonna's ""Papa Don't Preach"", debuted with Houston rock band Pure Rubbish at the 2002 MTV Film Awards. The album, which debuted at No. 1 on Billboards Heatseekers chart, was met with mixed critical reviews and, by May 2003, Osbourne was dropped from Epic Records. By autumn she was on the Sanctuary label, later recording a duet of ""Changes"" (a Black Sabbath song) with her father. The duet hit No. 1 on the UK charts and resulted in a reissue of Shut Up, titled Changes. ""Changes"" was one of a few tracks to have fallen down the charts (from 1–3) whilst selling more copies than the week it reached number 1. Osbourne was the first artists to top all three of the Billboard charts dance surveys in the same week with the ""Chris Cox Club Remix"" of ""One Word"". Her second album Sleeping in the Nothing was not without controversy, due to its reportedly heavily altered album cover, in which Osbourne appeared slimmer, despite her previous assertions of being happy with her size.

Osbourne made her debut as an actress with a starring role on 7 October 2004 on the ABC high school teenage drama Life as We Know It, where she played the supporting role of Deborah Beatrice Tynan. During an interview in late 2005, Osbourne denied reports she was ending her music career, saying: ""I don't know where the quit rumours came from – I've just recorded a version of 'Girls Just Want to Have Fun' with Cyndi Lauper.""

On 2 April 2004, Osbourne entered the Malibu rehab facility Promises after admitting to her family that she was addicted to painkillers. Over a year later, on 2 June, she checked into Las Encinas Hospital, a drug treatment centre in Pasadena, California, after a relapse. She entered another drug treatment facility in January 2009; she stayed for a month and later acknowledged that she had suffered a relapse of her addiction to painkillers. After 30 days, she was released; she has been quoted as saying that this was the first time she really thought rehab had helped her.In spring 2006, Osbourne modelled for Heatherette in a catwalk show. In June, she played the role of Wendy from Peter Pan in The Queen's Handbag and provided her voice for the animated film Live Freaky Die Freaky. Later that year, she became the face of the high street chain Accessorize. Osbourne co-hosted the 2006 edition of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! NOW!, a spin-off show of the main ITV programme. She hosted alongside Jeff Brazier in Australia, and Mark Durden-Smith in the London studio. Her one-off gigs include the 2002 MTV Film Awards, Top of the Pops Saturday, MTV's Isle of MTV, MTV UK and Ireland's red carpet coverage of the 2003 MTV Europe Music Awards, Popworld, The Sunday Night Project, the 2005 MTV Australia Video Music Awards and Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show. In spring 2006, Osbourne was one of the judges on Making Your Mind Up. At the September 2006 Electric Picnic festival in Ireland, Osbourne and her boyfriend, Matty Derham of the band Fields, held a wedding ceremony. Her representative later denied that the ceremony was legally binding because it did not meet Irish legal requirements, as at that time in Ireland, a couple couldn't get married in an outdoor venue. She later went on to date Matt Walker, a promoter and tour manager.

In February 2006, Osbourne was a guest judge for the Season One Episode Four of Project Catwalk on Sky1. She went on to host Seasons Two and Three of Project Catwalk in 2007 and 2008 respectively. In July 2007, Osbourne portrayed the role of prison matron Mama Morton in the musical drama Chicago for seven weeks at the Cambridge Theatre. In autumn 2007, Osbourne signed to BBC Radio 1 to host the Sunday night show, The Surgery; and on 7 October 2007, she went on air for the first time with the issue of self-harm. She was scheduled to return to the show in early 2009 and whilst she was away, Aled Haydn Jones from The Chris Moyles Show presented the show. Aled subsequently became the full-time presenter. In 2008, she featured in the short musical film The Town that Boars Me by photographer Ben Charles Edwards. The film also features Sadie Frost, Jodie Harsh, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, and Zandra Rhodes, amongst others. The film debuted in late summer at the Portobello Film Festival. In 2009, she appeared in an episode of Hotel Babylon, a British TV show aired on BBC One. She played Jo, a character very similar to herself.

On 19 January 2009, Osbourne was arrested for assault after allegedly slapping Daily Mirror columnist Zoe Griffin at a club in August 2008 after Griffin wrote a story that mocked Osbourne's then-boyfriend, Luke Worrall. In March 2009, Osbourne and Worrall were engaged, but later separated in July 2010 after he had an affair with model Elle Schneider. Osbourne presented ITV2's coverage of the National Television Awards with her brother Jack, and a documentary on Japanese pop culture called Kelly Osbourne: Turning Japanese for the same channel. In March 2009, Osbourne returned to television with the rest of the Osbourne family on Osbournes: Reloaded. On 1 September 2009, Osbourne released her first autobiography, Fierce, via Virgin Books. The book contains autobiographical elements, as well as advice and guidance through tough periods.

Nerina Pallot,"Pallot was born in London and brought up in Jersey by a half-French father and a mother from Prayag, India, together with her sister. Pallot played piano as a child and wrote her first song aged 13. She has identified seeing singer and pianist Kate Bush perform her hit song ""This Woman's Work"" on television series Wogan as a catalyst for her to pursue a music career. She attended Jersey College for Girls and received a music scholarship for Wellington College.","Pallot released her debut album, Dear Frustrated Superstar, on Polydor records in August 2001. This spawned two singles, ""Patience"" and ""Alien"". She was subsequently dropped from the label mainly due to failing sales. The album was eventually re-issued several years later after her second album, Fires had become a commercial success. Her then-manager Richard Ogden noted that his company spent ""three years managing her while she had a huge record deal and was a massive priority for Polydor. We did the best job we possibly could, but it just didn't happen"".

In 2003 she sang lead vocals on the track ""Truly"" on Delerium's album Chimera, which was also released as a single in the UK.Her second album, Fires, was released in April 2005 on her own independent label, Idaho. It was published by Chrysalis Music Publishing, to whom she remained signed and provided her with a development deal. They initially provided her with £50,000 to make the album. When that proved insufficient for Pallot's needs, she remortgaged her house to complete the rest of the album.

The album was produced and mixed by Howard Willing together with producers Eric Rosse who produced ""Learning to Breathe"" and ""Heart Attack"" (co-produced by Willing) and Wendy Melvoin who produced ""Damascus"". After the initial tracks were finished the rest of the record was apparently completed by Willing and Pallot flying files back and forth from London to Los Angeles.

The album was preceded by a download-only single, ""Everybody's Gone to War"". A second single from the record, ""Damascus"" was released in June 2005, and a third, ""All Good People"" (a Radio 2 single of the week) was released in September 2005. She performed at the 2005 Guildfest music festival and headlined her own show at Bush Hall in Shepherd's Bush, London later that year.

At the end of 2005, Pallot signed with 14th Floor Records (a Warner label), who re-issued the album after adding strings on some tracks, on 24 April 2006, earning Pallot a chart success by reaching Number 21. With over 100,000 sales it was certified gold in the UK.

The first single from the revamped album was ""Everybody's Gone to War"", which was playlisted on most major British radio stations. The single became the third most played song on British radio the week before its release, and reached Number 14 in the UK Singles Chart. She undertook her first full headlining tour in support of the Fires album in May 2006. During the year she also played headline shows in London at ICA, the Bloomsbury Theatre, Regent's Park Open Air Theatre and at Shepherd's Bush Empire.

The second single from the album was ""Sophia"", a re-recorded version, created in LA along with producer Mitchell Froom, entered the UK singles chart at Number 32. In April 2007, the song was nominated for an Ivor Novello Award, while she toured around the UK and Ireland in January and February of that year. The next single from the re-released version of Fires was ""Learning to Breathe"", which reached Number 70 in the UK singles chart.Pallot worked with several big name co-writers in preparation for the follow-up to Fires, including Linda Perry (Christina Aguilera's ""Beautiful"") and Rob Davis (Kylie Minogue's ""Can't Get You Out of My Head""). She also wrote an album's worth of material with Rick Nowels (Madonna's ""Power of Goodbye"", Belinda Carlisle's ""Heaven Is A Place on Earth""). However, she struggled with the co-writing process and in the end only self-written songs made the album.

The Graduate was released on 5 October 2009 in the UK and reached number 46 on the Official UK Albums Chart in its first week of release. The standard version of the album features 10 original tracks, whereas the iTunes version contains three additional tracks, and the deluxe version contains seven acoustic versions of the tracks. The album polarised critics, with some lauding it as her best album yet and others seeing her change of direction from Fires as a mistake. Having had no intention of releasing Fires 2, Pallot has defended the need for a progression between the two records. She toured the UK in October 2009, including a performance at Glasgow's Oran Mor venue on Wednesday 7 October, showcasing songs from the new album The Graduate.In July 2010, Pallot returned to Geffen Records and to the A&R that first signed her to Polydor while embarking on an eight-day tour around the UK and Ireland. She confirmed her new album would be titled Year of the Wolf via her Twitter page on 21 January 2011. She recorded with Bernard Butler for the album. The lead single was ""Put Your Hands Up"", released 24 April, while the album was released 13 June 2011.For her next project, Pallot decided to release an EP every month in 2014, as she ""just got sick of the album, tour, single... that whole cycle"". The first was called The Hold Tight in January, followed by We Should Break Up in February. She found that ""I'm at a point in my career where I can pretty much make it up now. I've also realised that a true fan base [...] cares about hearing as much music as they can get their hands on"". Pallot supported the releases with a handful of tour dates across the UK. In September 2015 she released her fifth album The Sound and the Fury.In 2015, Pallot independently released her fifth studio album The Sound and the Fury via her own Idaho label.2017 saw the release of Pallot's sixth studio album, Stay Lucky.Pallot has released six videos to go with singles from Dear Frustrated Superstar, Fires, and Year of the Wolf.

Her first video for ""Patience"", directed by Swedish director Emma Hvengaard, features Pallot in various scenes, notably wearing white and barefoot, continually floating to and from earth. ""Alien"" begins with Pallot lying down, it then becomes apparent that she had fallen onto a plumber's van, crushing it, and the video implies she has fallen from the sky ""like an alien"". The unreleased ""If I Know You"" video features multiple Nerinas fighting each other in a theatre.

For ""Damascus"", Pallot is seen playing piano and singing in a recording studio. Pallot's next video was for ""Everybody's Gone to War"", which includes cabbage-throwing goths and pineapple bombs. Her next video was for ""Sophia"", and was filmed in the middle of the desert in Morocco. It has Pallot sitting at a piano, playing and singing while fire surrounds her in a circle and her piano smokes and is also alight. Pallot's next performance, ""Learning to Breathe"", is more ""abstract"" and is computer-generated with her playing the guitar in a house with many pictures decorating the walls.

The video for ""Put Your Hands Up"", the lead single from Year of the Wolf, was shot in and around Lant Street in Southwark, London.
 * Pallot along with her husband Andy Chatterley wrote and produced two songs for Aphrodite, the 2010 album by Kylie Minogue, the title track ""Aphrodite"" and third single ""Better than Today"", which first appeared on Pallot's Buckminster Fuller EP from 2009.

In 2010, the advent of the Conservative-led coalition government following the (UK) general election influenced Petrie, who is a socialist, feminist, and lesbian, towards an increasing emphasis on politically focused songwriting, from a left-wing perspective.

Phildel,"Phildel's parents divorced and her mother married a religious fundamentalist. Her name, religion, lifestyle, and dress-code were changed by force. All of her personal possessions were seized and music became a forbidden evil within the household. This meant no radio, no CD player, and no piano. She was renamed Zara. For the next decade, Phildel was treated as a servant within her home.

However, Phildel spent lunchtimes with sympathetic music teachers and the school piano, at the girls' day school in Barnet (Queen Elizabeth's School for Girls). The school became a refuge in which she could write and play her own compositions. She eventually ran away from home at age 17 to escape her home-life and follow her dreams.

She soon purchased a second-hand computer and some music demo software packages and began putting together her first home-demo. Within a short while, it attracted the attention of Roger Watson (a former Chrysalis Music MD), and his support of her music led to collaborations with Spike MaClaren at Massive Attack's studio and Sam Dixon (known for his collaborations with many artists including KT Tunstall and Duffy's 'Rockferry' album).

In 2007, she wrote the piano piece ""The Kiss"" which was used for a worldwide TV advertising campaign for Apple iPad 3. It was also used for Marks & Spencer's advert. Her music has also been used on Persil and Omo washing powder. Another of her tracks ""Piano B"" was used for an Expedia commercial, followed by two more high-profile filmic campaigns in France in 2008/2009. In 2008, another track, ""Everyone's Memory Is Snow"" (renamed ""A Better World""), was used for the commercial for an insurance company, which Zizou praised.

She said ""Four of my tracks have been used in commercials around the world, two of them in the UK. They all came about in different ways, through different individuals, agencies or publishers. But my publisher Warner/Chappell Music have been very proactive in the realm of pitching my music for advertising. I re-invest whatever income I make into top-of-the-range studio equipment and cameras for documenting everything and creating visuals. So, it all goes back into my music."" She was complimented on her ""sonic soundscapes"" by Trevor Horn. Her music has been cited as an inspiration by Mariah Huehner, author of the True Blood and Angel comic books. They have also been used in theatre productions and by celebrity fashion designer Henrietta Ludgate's live shows. She soon returned the favour by wearing Henrietta's dress at a performance at St Pancras Old Church.

During December 2008, Phildel joined the bands Radiohead and Goldfrapp to become a Warner/Chappell Music Publishing artist.

In the summer of 2010, she performed on Saturday at the Latitude Festival.

She worked at the world-famous Metropolis Recording Studio, to complete her neo-classical album. Called ""Qi"" Chinese for Energy. This was then followed by the recording of her artist album (for Decca). Her debut album for Decca The Disappearance of the Girl, was released on 4 March 2013.

She was invited on 23 May 2013 by BBC Radio Merseyside's Dave Monks to his 'Introducing' show after a recommendation from Stevo, she performed acoustic renditions of ""Storm Song"" and ""Holes in Your Coffin"".

In the summer of 2013, she collaborated with Sleepthief in America, on his new album ""Mortal Longing"". The two tracks in which she appeared are ""Dust & Cloud"" and ""Where The Heart Is"".

She then performed at Vancouver Folk Music Festival on 20 July, as part of her USA and Canada tour.

In Nov, she collaborated with Peter S. Beagle (author of The Last Unicorn) on a new track 'Dark Water Down', mixing poetry and music. They then appeared together at a gig at Cafe Du Nord in San Francisco, USA.

She was interviewed by Gareth Lloyd on BBC Three Counties Radio as part of 'BBC Introducing'.

She currently lives in the Chilterns, where some of her videos are filmed.

On February 4, 2015, a remastered version of her album Qi was released.

Jessica Pratt (soprano),N/A,"In addition to appearances in operas by Rossini such as her 2010 performances as Desdemona in the composer's Otello at the Rossini in Wildbad Festival, Pratt has been featured in significant premieres of two of the composer's rarer works. These include the title role in Armida in its United Kingdom premiere in 2010 and, two years later, the United States premiere of Ciro in Babilonia.

Armida was given by the Garsington Opera Festival in 2010, where critic Andrew Clark noted: ""what sets the performance alight is Jessica Pratt's Armida. This young English soprano has a ringing top, good looks, stage temperament and enough vocal agility to make sense of Rossini's love-struck heroine.""

Another critic, Robert Farr, reviewing the same production, notes: As Armida, hers was the most amazing vocal performance of the evening. The role is one of the several manifestly vocally difficult and demanding ones that Rossini wrote for his mistress, and later wife, Isabella Colbran, one of the most renowned divas of the day. Not only are its vocal demands considerable, but also it is a very big sing too concluding with the final display aria demanded by all singers in Rossini's time to finish off the performance ... [L]ike the rest of the audience, I appreciated the fact that she sang it with musicality, clarity of diction and purity and beauty of tone, all allied to the smooth vocal extension and flexibility evident throughout her whole performance.

Then, in 2012, Pratt sang the role of Amira in Ciro in Babilonia at the Caramoor Belcanto Festival which resulted in The New York Times critic, Anthony Tommasini, noting that ""the soprano Jessica Pratt was also outstanding as Amira, singing with gleaming sound, free and easy high notes, agile coloratura runs and lyrical grace."" This production went on to be presented by the same cast at the following month's Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro where it was recorded.

Prior to this, in 2011 at the same Rossini Festival, Pratt had performed the title role in the second staged production of Adelaide di Borgogna since 1825.

Shama Rahman,"Rahman was born in Al Ain, United Arab Emirates to Bangladeshi parents, a medical doctor and classical singer. She has lived on three different continents and trained under the tutelage lineage of Pt Ravi Shankar of the Maihar gharana.","Rahman's original band members have included Peter Edwards (piano or clarinet) who also recorded on the album Fable:Time, Domenico Angarano (bass or kaos pad), William Pearce Smith (violin), Christopher Lane (guitar) and Felix Higginbottom (percussion or drumkit), Nicolas Rouger (saxophone), Andres Castellanos (bass) and Oberon King (percussion or drumkit). She writes and arranges all music and lyrics from her poems. Rahman and her band weaves sitar, urban folk, stories and song together. Together with her band she mingles storytelling, metaphysics and poetry into their music and creates multi-layered harmonies and energy-driven lyrical rhythms with international influences evoking genres from punk to folk, classical to jazz, swing to bossa nova, spoken word to dubstep and drum and bass to create their own unique urban jazz folk genre.

Rahman has performed as a solo artist and with her band and various guest artists in Bangladesh, England, Ireland, France, Germany and Bangladesh. She has performed at the Royal Festival Hall, Southbank Centre, headlined the Modern Mela in 2011's Alchemy Festival, and the 2014 London Jazz Festival. Major festivals include The Secret Garden Party, SilFest, SpitalFields Festival, featured on Womad radio, Supersonix festival (supporting Seth Lakeman and Ska Cubano), Wilderness, One Love Festival, special commission for Eastern Electronic Festival, Un-Convention and Fête de la Musique. She played live in the studio at BBC London 94.9 on the Sunny and Shay Show. Her solo performances include India festival in Belfast, opening for Into the Woods musical at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, NYE at The Troubadour.

She has been commissioned by MOJO for a re-interpretation of The Beatles song ""Eleanor Rigby"" using her own unique jazz-sitar style featuring pianist Peter Edwards. Her solo performances encompass classical sitar (India festival, Belfast), storytelling with the sitar (SHUNT, V&A Museum of Childhood, Tales in the Tower) and her solo project involving 'looped' sitar electric soundscapes where she unconventionally bows it and creates percussion.

In 2014, she toured with in Place of War (IPOW) artists from UK, India, Congo, Zimbabwe and Kenya – Nucleya, OCTOPIZZO, Louis Barabbas, Alesh Officiel – which culminated in four performances at Shambala Festival with Sandie Shaw. She has featured on Asian Dub Foundation's album Signal and the Noise, producers Chemo's LP In The Evening and State of Bengal.

She has also had numerous collaborations with musicians from all over the world, notably with Asian Dub Foundation, State of Bengal, the London Sitar Ensemble at Southbank, London Bulgarian Choir and the Doves at the BBC Radio 2 Electric Proms in the Roundhouse, sitarist/vocalist with Orchestra Elastique on Berlin tour, SHUNT, Salisbury Arts Festival and LIFT, television appearance as sitarist/vocalist with Bangladeshi musician James and recorded with musicians from Bengal, including producer Buno from revolutionary band Bangla.

While at university, Rahman was the head of marketing for Europe's largest internet radio station. She ran music events combining unknown talent with known names. In 2009, after a break of a few years, she resumed this as artistic director and producer of ""The Gung Ho Down"", which is a showcase platform for performing arts from all genres and disciplines, artist-led collaborations and promotes artists.

In June 2013, Rahman's debut album Fable:Time was released. Each song on the album unveils a chapter in an overall story about how time affects us – its illusions, deceptions and myths. The album mimics the non-linearity of time and is on a circular track listing. From this, she has visualised one overall narrative by creating a series of eight videos which are all episodes in a series. Some of her spoken-word pieces are featured in this album and has led her to perform at the DSC Literary Festival and Hackney Word Festival.

As a music composer for stage and screen her credits include: UK theatre production Harlesden High Street, the BBC drama series Bishaash, BritDoc Mass E Bhat and Bengali film Runaway.

In October 2013, Rahman was interviewed by Nadia Ali on BBC Asian Network.","Title—Album details—Chart positions—Certifications,Title—Album details—Fable:Time—Certifications—*Released: 16 June 2013 *Label: *Formats: CD,",N/A,A 21st-century english women singer,1983,2009–present,N/A,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shama_Rahman

Susheela Raman,"Susheela Raman's parents are Tamils from Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu, India, who arrived in London, UK in the mid-sixties. At the age of four, Raman and her family left the UK for Australia. Susheela grew up singing South Indian classical music and began giving recitals at an early age. She recalls how her family ""were eager to keep our Tamil culture alive."" As a teenager in Sydney she started her own band, describing its sound as ""funk and rock and roll"", before branching out into more blues and jazz-based music, which demanded quite different voice techniques. She tried to bring these streams together when in 1995 she travelled to India to rediscover her roots by way of further exploring Carnatic music.Returning to England in 1997, she started to work with her partner, guitarist/producer Sam Mills who had recorded ""Real Sugar"" with a Bengali singer named Paban Das Baul. According to Raman ""it bridged a gap and found common ground for one particular kind of Indian music to be expressed to a new audience."" In 1999, Raman co-wrote songs for the album One and One is One by Joi, also performing on the track ""Asian Vibes."" Mills had worked with West African musicians in the group Tama which also opened musical contact points within the Parisian music scene.After a period of three years collaborating with Sam Mills, Raman released her first album Salt Rain in 2001 on Narada, an American subsidiary of EMI.

The album went gold in France and in the UK was shortlisted for the Mercury Music Prize. Raman also won the Best Newcomer award from BBC Radio 3.

Salt Rain drew on traditional Tamil music blended with jazz-folk and pop influences. It featured original material, as well as old songs Raman sang at recitals when younger.In 2003 Raman released her second album Love Trap which featured amongst other collaborators the Nigerian drummer Tony Allen and Tuvan singer Albert Kuvezin of the group Yat-Kha.

The title track is a re-interpretation of an Ethiopian song by Mahmoud Ahmed.Music for Crocodiles, Raman's third album, was released in 2005. It had been partly recorded in Chennai (Madras), India. The album included ""The Same Song"" which was used by Mira Nair for the end credits of her film The Namesake. (Nair also used Raman's version of the 1960s Hindi film song ""Ye Mera Divanapan Hai"" from the previous album).

On Music for Crocodiles Raman sang for the first time in French on ""L'Ame Volatile"".

Raman's training in Carnatic classical music makes its presence felt in Tamil classical titles such as ""Sharavana,"" her singing ""Meanwhile"" (on the same album) in a rāgam called Kanakaangi, and in the song ""Light Years"" which features a melody in Kalyani rāgam as well as the veena playing of Punya 'Devi' Srinivas.

In 2006 Susheela was again nominated for a BBC World Music Award and was the subject of a one-hour documentary by French-German TV Channel Arte, called Indian Journey directed by Mark Kidel.Susheela's deal with Narada ended in 2006 and that year she independently recorded an album 331⁄3, a set of re-imaginings of tracks from the nineteen sixties and seventies. Artists covered include Bob Dylan, John Lennon, The Velvet Underground, Captain Beefheart, Jimi Hendrix, Can and Throbbing Gristle. The album features long term collaborators Sam Mills on guitar, Vincent Segal on cello, and tabla player and percussionist Aref Durvesh.

The album was released in April 2007 in France on the independent label XIII Bis.Raman garnered acclaim for her live performances. She continued to research and discover music from Tamil Nadu, studying in 2007 with the Bhakti singer Kovai Kamla.In 2011, Raman released Vel, marking a change in musical direction which was well received.

She followed this up with a series of concerts which showcased her new musical direction, demonstrating, as her reviewers put it ""a rousing comeback"".Through 2011 to 2013, Raman worked with Sufi Qawali singers and musicians in Lahore in addition to Rajasthani musicians, and continued to explore ecstatic and devotional musical styles.

In 2013, Raman returned to the stage in London at the Royal Festival Hall as part of the Alchemy Festival, having previously played at the Jaipur Literary Festival.In September 2013 Susheela Raman announced a new album, as yet untitled, inviting pledges from fans to ensure its release in spring 2014. Of this she said: ""The record I am making now reflects my work in recent years living in London but travelling to work with master musicians from India and Pakistan. It features master musicians from Rajasthan, and spectacular Sufi Qawwali singers from Pakistan. In addition to my longstanding companions guitarist/producer Sam Mills and tabla demon Aref Durvesh, Fela Kuti’s legendary drummer Tony Allen and French cellist Vincent Segal also make an appearance. It is a really exciting album with singing in English, Tamil, Panjabi, Urdu, Marwari and Bengali. It has some amazing playing and guest vocals by Kutle Khan and Rizwan Muazzam. It’s a big, beautiful, ambitious, groundbreaking album and ... it’s all about the songs.It’s a work in progress and a strong start has been made. While the Qawals and Rajasthanis were in London this April we had some great sessions and laid down the basic recording for about nine tracks so far and now are looking for funding to complete the recording and editing, to mix, master and then to promote the album.""

The album was finally released on 1 March 2014 as Queen Between.","Returning to England in 1997, she started to work with her partner, guitarist/producer Sam Mills who had recorded ""Real Sugar"" with a Bengali singer named Paban Das Baul.

Louise Redknapp,"Louise Elizabeth Nurding was born in Lewisham, London. Her father was a builder and her mother worked at Gatwick Airport. Louise and her two younger brothers grew up in Eltham, London, and Oxted, Surrey. She describes herself as having come from a single-parent family with her mum.

At the age of 11, she won a scholarship to the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts in London, where she met her future Eternal colleague Kéllé Bryan on her first day.","While out clubbing at the age of 15, Louise met the music producer Denis Ingoldsby, who was forming an all-girl group. She subsequently introduced Denis to Kéllé Bryan. Kéllé and Louise, together with sisters Easther and Vernie Bennett, formed the band Eternal in 1992. The group performed R&B, and recorded a number of hits during the 1990s. Eternal's debut single ""Stay"" entered the UK charts at number sixteen and climbed to number four. Louise left the group in 1995 to pursue a solo career, amid unsubstantiated rumours that she was forced to leave because a radio station in the United States dedicated to black music would not promote the racially mixed group. Redknapp says that she left because she was miserable and homesick.In late 1995, Louise signed a record deal with First Avenue management and EMI Records. Now professionally known simply as ""Louise"", her debut solo single was the orchestral ballad ""Light of My Life"" (which reached number eight on the UK charts). Her second solo release, ""In Walked Love"" (previously a hit from the self-titled 1992 album by the dance/pop group Exposé), fared less well and missed the UK Top Ten.

However, Louise's third single, ""Naked"", turned things around and became her biggest hit to date, peaking at number five in the UK.

Louise's debut solo album, also entitled Naked, was subsequently released in 1996 on the back of the single's success. The album received lukewarm reviews, but nevertheless peaked at number seven in the UK album charts. It was later certified Platinum by the BPI for over 300,000 copies sold. Two further singles were released: ""Undivided Love"" (UK #5) and ""One Kiss From Heaven"" (UK #9).

In 1997, Louise returned with the single ""Arms Around The World"", which reached number four in the UK. Her second solo album, Woman in Me, peaked at number five in the UK and went on to gain multi-platinum status. The album also made an impact across Europe, charting well in a number of countries. To support and celebrate the success of the album, Louise embarked on a UK wide 'sell-out' arena tour of over twenty dates, including Wembley Arena.

""Let's Go Round Again"" (a cover of a song by the Average White Band) was the second single released from the album, which reached number ten.

At the start of 1998, Louise's career was at a high point: her second album had gone platinum, she was on the cover of magazines such as Smash Hits and GQ, and she had been voted Sexiest Woman in the World by the readers of FHM magazine.

In 1998, Louise married the footballer Jamie Redknapp, then focused on making what she described as her ""most personal album to date"", Elbow Beach, released in 2000. Louise was more involved in the process of this album than her previous two, co-writing all 12 tracks and co-producing most of them.

The lead single from Elbow Beach, the R&B-styled ""2-Faced"" went straight into the charts at number three, and became Louise's highest-charting single. Despite initial hype and critical praise, total sales for Elbow Beach were weaker than the previous two productions, and the album peaked at number twelve. The same year, Louise was hired to 'sex up' the 2000 National Egg Awareness Campaign.

After Elbow Beach was released, she had one album left on her five-album deal with EMI (including Eternal's Always and Forever). In 2001, the label decided to release a greatest hits compilation, incorporating all of her top ten hit singles (including those she had performed with Eternal), called Changing Faces – The Best of Louise. The collection featured three new tracks, including a cover of Five Star's 1987 hit ""The Slightest Touch"". The album peaked at number nine in the UK, and she embarked on the second solo tour of her career.

EMI later released a second greatest hits album entitled Finest Moments, with a slightly different track listing.In 2002, Redknapp signed a £1.5 million contract with her manager Oliver Smallman's Positive Records (a division of Universal Music) to record her fourth solo album. The album was due for release in 2004 alongside the single ""Bounce Back"". However, due to the singer becoming pregnant with her son Charley, the album was never released. The only single released from the album was the double A-side ""Pandora's Kiss""/""Don't Give Up"", which peaked at number five and raised money for Tickled Pink/Breast Cancer Care. The unreleased album saw Louise work with the likes of Sylvia Bennett Smith and Marc 'M2E' Smith, Mark Hill and Pete Martin. The album would also have included Louise's first duet with boy band 3rd Wish on the track ""Don't Ever Change"".In August 2017, Redknapp posted a picture of herself in the recording studio on her Instagram account, showing that she had been working on new music. On 13 September 2017, Louise revealed she would be returning to the music industry by announcing her first live show in more than 15 years at Under The Bridge in London on 22 December 2017. Titled 'Intimate & Live', the show had enough demand for tickets selling out in under 5 minutes, leading promoters and Louise to announce additional dates for January 2018 in Manchester, Glasgow, and Birmingham.

Carmen Reece,"Reece was born and raised in London. As a child, she played the flute and piano, participated in ballet and tap dancing, and practiced singing and songwriting. She graduated from the BRIT School.","Reece began her music career with singles in England, and songwriting for other artists. She eventually met songwriter Mark J. Feist, who brought her to Los Angeles to help build her music career. Her first singles were titled ""How Freaky Can You Get"" and ""You Got Me,"" both released in the UK. Her first album Love in Stereo was released in the summer of 2010, co-written with Feist. The album was released independently, through Feist's own label Real MF LTD. ""Right Here"" was released as the lead single. The song reached No. 3 in the US on the Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart.

In 2014, Carmen signed her first publishing deal to Universal Music under Donna Caseine and mid 2019 signed her second deal to UMPG. She has worked with writers and producers including Rodney Jerkins, Harmony Samuels, Tommy Brown, Tricky Stewart, Stereotypes, RedOne, Carole Bayer Sager, Fraser T. Smith and R. City. She formed a production partnership with fellow musician PK in late 2019 called ShrekpoPPins.

In the end of 2018, Reece released the first single called ""Friday"" from her upcoming 80's-pop self-titled album. The second single, ""Say It,"" was released in early 2019.

In a March 2008 BBC News Magazine article regarding gender stereotypes too often influencing which musical instrument schoolchildren learn, the electric guitar is still seen as a male instrument, despite great female exponents in recent years, according to Regan. Based on her own experiences, she said: There was no opportunity to learn anything other than traditional orchestral instruments at school and so I muddled along on my own and felt quite isolated as I went to an all-girl school and none of my peers seemed to have any interest in electric guitar. It seemed like a freakish thing for me to be interested in. I was quite popular at school and had a load of friends, but this was just seen as 'one of my little quirks'.",N/A,N/A,N/A,"Anglo-Irish singer, songwriter and musician",1962,1981–present,Gothic rock,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julianne_Regan

Lou Rhodes,"Lou Rhodes was married to Crispin Robinson and has two sons. She lives in rural Wiltshire, England.","Although Lamb is famous for blending electronica with jazz and elements of drum and bass, Rhodes's solo work is more organic and rooted in folk music. Rhodes expressed a doubt that she will ever return to electronica. She combines finely tuned acoustic guitars—the essence of almost every arrangement—with violin, double bass, and rich percussion. Lyrically, her songs can be described as extremely romantic, soulful and very personal, this is how Rhodes explains the last album's lyrics: Sometimes I think, ""My God, I keep writing all these love songs,"" and I really struggle with that. I think I'm a bit of an emotional junkie, you know? It seems to be what consumes me. The heart never ceases to provide me with subject matter. I don't know why that is. Someone asked me the other day, ""Are you in love with being in love?"" And I couldn't really answer that question.Lou Rhodes is also a published author. Her children's picture book, 'The Phlunk' (Lou Rhodes/Tori Elliott ), published by Strata Books in 2012, received good reviews. Follow-up The Phlunk's Worldwide Symphony appeared in 2015. In 2012 Rhodes also contributed an essay to 'The First Time I Heard The Smiths', part of an ongoing series where musicians/writers tell their stories of first hearing the music of an iconic artist or band.Besides her solo work, Rhodes has provided vocals for a number of other artists. In 1996 she featured on the track ""Azura"" on the 808 State album Don Solaris. Released as a single, it reached no. 79. In 1997 she provided a vocal for the song ""Kanon"" on the album Truth? by the Japanese guitarist Sugizo. She also co-wrote and featured on the song ""Humanity"" on the A Guy Called Gerald album Essence released in 2000. The same year she also featured on the soundtrack for the film The Princess and the Warrior, performing the song ""Escape (Afraid of No One)"".

Mia Rose,N/A,"Mia Rose was born in Wimbledon, London. Rose opened her YouTube account on 29 December 2006 during her Christmas break from university. She posted daily videos singing various cover songs and within a month set a record number of subscriptions for a musician. As of November 2010, she has more than 265,000 YouTube subscribers. In 2008, following her success on YouTube, she appeared at Google Zeitgeist and was a speaker at the SIME Conference in Sweden.

In May 2009, she wrote, recorded and marketed the song ""Let Go"", selling it on iTunes in Portugal, where it became the best selling download, and got to number 2 on the Portuguese charts.

She and Jordanian musician Hanna Gargour performed the song ""Waiting on the World to Change"". Queen Rania of Jordan noted this song was an example of how art can promote a reduction of the international cultural divide.

Her second self-released single, the double A-side ""What Would Christmas Be Like?"" / ""Fallin’ For You"" was released on 2 December 2009. ""What Would Christmas Be Like?"" was written by Rose, while ""Fallin' For You"" is a Colbie Caillat song.

Her videos have been watched over 140 million times on YouTube.

She was featured in Rolling Stone, The Age, and on a BBC Radio 5 Live interview.

In January 2007, Ryan Leslie signed Rose to NextSelection/Universal. A month later she was signed by Tommy Mottola to the Mottola Company for management.

Annie Ross,"Ross was born in Surrey, England, the daughter of Scottish vaudevillians John ""Jack"" Short and Mary Dalziel Short (née Allan). Her brother was Scottish entertainer and theatre producer and director Jimmy Logan. She first appeared on stage at age three. At the age of four, she travelled to New York by ship with her family; she later recalled that they ""got the cheapest ticket, which was right in the bowels of the ship"".

Shortly after arriving in the city, she won a token contract with MGM through a children's radio contest run by Paul Whiteman. She subsequently moved with her aunt, Scottish-American singer and actress Ella Logan, to Los Angeles, and her mother, father and brother returned to Scotland. She did not see her parents again until fourteen years later. At the age of seven, she sang ""The Bonnie Banks o' Loch Lomond"" in Our Gang Follies of 1938, and played Judy Garland's character's sister in Presenting Lily Mars (1943).

At the age of 14, she wrote the song ""Let's Fly"", which won a songwriting contest and was recorded by Johnny Mercer and The Pied Pipers.

At the end of 10th grade, she left school, changed her name to Annie Ross, and went to Europe, where she established her singing career. She changed her surname to Ross during the plane trip to Prestwick; in a 2011 interview, she said: ""My aunt was very fanciful and she said I had an Irish grandmother called Ross, so that's where that surname came from"".","In 1952, Ross met Prestige Records owner Bob Weinstock, who asked her to write lyrics to a jazz solo in a similar way to King Pleasure, a practice that would later be known as vocalese. The next day, she presented him with ""Twisted"", a treatment of saxophonist Wardell Gray's 1949 composition of the same name, a classic example of the genre. The song, first released in 1952 (later collected on the album King Pleasure Sings/Annie Ross Sings), was an underground hit, and resulted in her winning Down Beat magazine's New Star award.

In February 1956, the British music magazine NME reported that Ross's version of the song ""I Want You to Be My Baby"" was banned by the BBC due to the lyric ""Come upstairs and have some loving"".

She recorded seven albums with Lambert, Hendricks & Ross between 1957 and 1962. Their first, Sing a Song of Basie (1957), was to have been performed by a group of singers hired by Jon Hendricks and Dave Lambert with Ross brought in only as vocal consultant. It was decided that the trio should attempt to record the material and overdub all the additional vocals themselves, but the first two tracks were recorded and deemed unsatisfactory so they ditched the dubbing idea. The resulting album was a success, and the trio became an international hit. Over the next five years, Lambert, Hendricks & Ross toured all over the world and recorded such albums as The Hottest New Group in Jazz (1959), Sing Ellington (1960), High Flying (1962), and The Real Ambassadors (1962), written by Dave Brubeck and featuring Louis Armstrong and Carmen McRae.

Ross left the group in 1962 and in 1964 opened a nightclub in London. Annie's Room hosted Joe Williams, Nina Simone, Stuff Smith, Blossom Dearie, Anita O'Day, Jon Hendricks, and Erroll Garner.

Her adulthood film roles included Liza in the film Straight On till Morning (1972), Claire in Alfie Darling (1976), Diana Sharman in Funny Money (1983), Vera Webster in Superman III (1983), Mrs. Hazeltine in Throw Momma from the Train (1987), Rose Brooks in Witchery (1988), Loretta Cresswood in Pump Up the Volume (1990), Tess Trainer in Robert Altman's Short Cuts (1993), and Lydia in Blue Sky (1994). She also appeared as Granny Ruth in the horror films Basket Case 2 (1990) and Basket Case 3: The Progeny (1991). She also had a bit part in Robert Altman's The Player in 1992. Ross also starred in Scottish Television's comedy-drama Charles Endell Esquire (1979).

She provided the speaking voice for Britt Ekland in The Wicker Man (1973), and Ingrid Thulin's singing voice in Salon Kitty (1976). On stage, she appeared in Cranks (1955; London and New York City), The Threepenny Opera (1972), The Seven Deadly Sins (1973) at the Royal Opera House, Kennedy's Children (1975) at Arts Theatre, London, Side by Side by Sondheim, and in the Joe Papp production of The Pirates of Penzance (1982).","

In 1990 she married Nigel S. Brown. Her grandfather built the world-famous Exbury Gardens in Hampshire where she was raised. Noted for its cultivation of rhododendrons, a pink ""Charlotte de Rothschild"" was named for her.","Charlotte de Rothschild is currently signed to classical record label Nimbus Records. She has recorded works by Robert Schumann, Mathilde Hannah von Rothschild, Roger Quilter and Gabriel Fauré with accompanist Adrian Farmer.

Carina Round,N/A,"In the summer of 1996, following a gig in a basement acoustic club in Wolverhampton, Round was given a three-night support at Ronnie Scott's club in Birmingham. This led to support slots with the likes of David Gray, Miles Hunt, Ben Christophers, Mark Eitzel, Cousteau, Elbow, I am Kloot, Turin Brakes, Ed Harcourt and Ryan Adams, who after she supported him in Birmingham, invited her to be his guest at his London shows. At these shows, they again performed their co-written song ""Idiots Dance"" and ""Come Pick Me Up"" as encores. The following months saw Round joined by Simon Jason Smith on double-bass, Marcus Galley on drums and guitarist Tom Livemore. Their first gig together was a special one-off supporting Coldplay at the Birmingham Songwriters Festival.

This band recorded debut album The First Blood Mystery at Magic Garden Studios with friend and producer Gavin Monaghan. The album was recorded and mixed in ten days, and released in the UK through Animal Noise in 2001. Round then toured the UK with Glenn Tilbrook.

She returned in 2003 with The Disconnection, again recorded at Magic Garden Studios with Gavin Monaghan. The album was released in the UK with a cover shot by Anoushka Fisz (wife of Dave Stewart from the Eurythmics who supported her since), then released in 2004 with a different, less visually disturbing cover photo, on Interscope in the US. The album garnered comparisons to Björk, Jeff Buckley and Robert Plant. Round promoted The Disconnection with a tour of the UK in late 2003, and another tour in January 2004. This was followed by a month-long tour of the US before returning to the UK for another tour with Damien Dempsey and James Blunt.

Round moved to LA in 2005 to produce Slow Motion Addict with Glen Ballard, which featured a more accessible, electronic-embellished sound. The album's release was delayed by a full year, but was eventually released in the US in 2007.

That same year, she appeared on ""Cruel Melody"", the title track of the debut album of Black Light Burns, a band fronted by Limp Bizkit guitarist Wes Borland. Also in 2007, Round was chosen as Annie Lennox's support act for her US tour, which was followed by dates in the UK later that year and in early 2008.

On 12 May 2009, Round released a five-track EP called Things You Should Know. The EP is available on general digital release, with physical copies available only at her shows. Pre-orders of the digital EP came with two extra tracks – acoustic versions of ""Do You"" and ""For Everything a Reason"". A video and a remix are available for the first track on the EP, ""Backseat"".

In fall 2009 Round became a touring member of Puscifer, Maynard James Keenan of Tool's Arizona based project, working on their album Conditions of My Parole and began opening the live shows.

During this time, Round also sang on The Twilight Singers' album Dynamite Steps. She also worked with Ballard again and Oscar-nominated composer John Debney on a song composed for the film Valentines Day. She wrote with Academy Award nominee Marco Beltrami, as well as finishing up an album with her alt-country side project Early Winters, which was self-released earlier in the year.

Her songs 'For Everything A Reason' and 'Do You' are featured in the FX series American Horror Story.

In October 2011 it was announced that Round would be touring with Puscifer again. She opened for Puscifer at the Seattle, Washington opening show of the North American Conditions of My Parole tour on 7 November 2011. This was in addition to performing as a member of Puscifer.

Carina Round released Tigermending, an 11-track album produced by Round and Dan Burns on 1 May 2012 via Dehisce Records and distributed through The Orchard. Collaborators include Dave Stewart and Brian Eno (""The Secret of Drowning"") and Billy Corgan (""Got to Go (2000 Years BC Mix"").

She also appears as a guest vocalist on Valleyheart, the 2013 album by Canadian singer-songwriter Justin Rutledge, who is one of Round's bandmates in Early Winters. She also contributed vocals to the song ""Turn Around"" from his album ""Early Widows.""

In April 2013 she performed with Puscifer at Coachella and Lollapalooza Chile and Brazil.

In February 2014 she appears as a guest vocalist on the track, ""I Feel"" on Sierra Swan's album ""Good Soldier"", produced by Billy Corgan. She also appeared as a vocalist on tracks ""In My Room"" and ""The Truth Is..."" from Sierra Swan's album ""Girl Who Cried Wolf"" and collaborated with Sierra Swan in addition to Joel Shearer, Blair Sinta and Curt Schneider on a project called ""Pushka,"" contributing vocals.

in 2014 she collaborated with Aiden Hawken on the song ""Come Undone"" from the album Making Patterns Rhyme: A Tribute to Duran Duran.

She provided guest vocals on ""Tower"" on The Beta Machine's album ""All This Time.""

In 2016 and 2019 she toured with Tears for Fears, handling backup vocals and singing lead on the songs ""Suffer the Children"" and ""Woman in Chains"".","

Patricia Routledge,"Katherine Patricia Routledge was born on 17 February 1929 in Birkenhead. Her father was a haberdasher and gentlemen's outfitter. She was educated at Birkenhead High School, and the University of Liverpool. She gained a degree with honours in English Language and Literature. She was involved in the University's dramatic society, where she worked closely with the academic Edmund Colledge, who both directed and acted in several of the society's productions. It was Colledge who persuaded her to pursue an acting career. After graduating, she trained at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School and returned to Liverpool to begin her acting career at the Liverpool Playhouse.","Routledge has had a prolific career in theatre, particularly musical theatre, in the United Kingdom and the United States. Her vocal range was labelled as a mezzo-soprano and a contralto. She has been a long-standing member of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), appearing in such acclaimed productions as the 1983 Richard III, which starred Antony Sher in the title role. Her West End credits include Little Mary Sunshine, Cowardy Custard, Virtue in Danger, Noises Off, The Importance of Being Earnest, and The Solid Gold Cadillac, as well as a number of less successful vehicles. She was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her work in And a Nightingale Sang in 1979. A classically trained singer, she has occasionally made forays into operetta including taking the title role in an acclaimed production of Jacques Offenbach's La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein at the 1978 Camden Festival; ""As the Grand Duchess she invested every phrase, spoken or sung [...] with wit and meaning, and coloured her tone to express a wide variety of emotions. Never did she resort to the hoydenish behaviour that this role – in British productions at least – seems to invite.""

Routledge made her Broadway debut in Roger Milner's outrageous comedy How's the World Treating You? in 1966, returning in the short-lived 1968 musical Darling of the Day, for which she won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical, sharing the honour with Leslie Uggams of Hallelujah, Baby! Following this, Routledge had roles in several more unsuccessful Broadway productions including a musical called Love Match, in which she played Queen Victoria; the legendary 1976 Leonard Bernstein flop 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, in which she portrayed every U.S. First Lady from Abigail Adams to Eleanor Roosevelt; and a 1981 musical, Say Hello to Harvey – based on the Mary Coyle Chase play Harvey (1944) – which closed in Toronto before reaching New York City.

In 1980, Routledge played Ruth in the Joseph Papp production of The Pirates of Penzance, co-starring American actor Kevin Kline and pop vocalist Linda Ronstadt, at the Delacorte Theatre in New York City's Central Park, one of a series of Shakespeare in the Park summer events. The show was a hit and transferred to Broadway the following January, with Estelle Parsons replacing Routledge. A DVD of the Central Park production, with Routledge, was released in October 2002. She also performed in Façade at New York's Carnegie Recital Hall.

Routledge won a Laurence Olivier Award in 1988 for her portrayal of the Old Lady in Leonard Bernstein's Candide in the London cast of the critically acclaimed Scottish Opera production. One critic noted ""She stopped the show with 'I am so easily assimilated', and her long narration worked on at least two levels – it was both hilarious and oddly moving."" She also played the role of Nettie Fowler to great acclaim in the 1993 London production of Carousel. In a 2006 Hampstead Theatre production of The Best of Friends, she portrayed Dame Laurentia McLachlan. In 2008, she played Queen Mary in Royce Ryton's play Crown Matrimonial. More recent work include the narrator in The Carnival of the Animals with the Nash Ensemble in 2010, the role of Dame Myra Hess in the play Admission: One Shilling in 2011, and Lady Markby in An Ideal Husband at the Chichester Festival Theatre in 2014.Routledge's screen credits include To Sir, with Love (1967), Pretty Polly (both 1967), 30 Is a Dangerous Age, Cynthia, The Bliss of Mrs. Blossom, Don't Raise the Bridge, Lower the River (all 1968), If It's Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium (1969) and Girl Stroke Boy (1971).

Routledge's early television appearances included a role in Steptoe and Son, in the episode ""Seance in a Wet Rag and Bone Yard"" (1974), as a clairvoyant called Madame Fontana. She also appeared in Coronation Street, and as a white witch in Doctor at Large (1971). Also in 1971, Routledge played Mrs. Jennings in the BBC mini-series production of Sense and Sensibility. However, she did not come to prominence on television until she featured in monologues written for her by Alan Bennett and later Victoria Wood in the 1980s. She first appeared in Bennett's A Woman of No Importance in 1982, and then as the opinionated Kitty in Victoria Wood: As Seen on TV in 1985. She performed two further monologues in Bennett's Talking Heads in 1987 and 1998. Routledge was nominated for a British Academy Television Award for Best Actress for the monologue ""A Lady of Letters"".

In 1989 Routledge accepted the lead role of Hetty Wainthropp in an ITV mystery drama, Hetty Wainthropp: Missing Persons. ITV opted not to pursue a series after the pilot episode, but in 1996 the BBC produced the first series of Hetty Wainthropp Investigates, with Routledge again in the lead role. The show co-starred Dominic Monaghan as her assistant and Derek Benfield as her husband. It was first aired in January 1996, and ran until the autumn of 1998, with one special episode in 1999. Monaghan, who went on to enjoy a Hollywood career, has since credited Routledge as ""an amazing teacher"" who taught him some ""very valuable lessons"" in acting.

In 1990, Routledge was cast as Hyacinth Bucket in the comedy series Keeping Up Appearances. She portrayed a formerly working-class woman with social pretensions (insisting her surname be pronounced ""bouquet"") and delusions of grandeur (her oft-mentioned ""candlelight suppers""). Routledge delighted in portraying Hyacinth, as she claimed she couldn't stand people like her in real life. In 1991, she won a British Comedy Award for her portrayal, and she was later nominated for two BAFTA TV Awards in 1992 and 1993. The series ended at Routledge's request in 1995 despite its ongoing popularity. She wished to pursue other roles as a character actress. During an interview on Australian TV Patricia stated: ""I'd much rather people look back and say 'I remember that' than say 'Oh, is that still on?'"" Another reason she wished the series to end was that she felt that the writer, Roy Clarke, was rewriting old scripts.

She has also played several real-life characters for television, including Barbara Pym, and, in a dramatised BBC Omnibus biographical documentary of 1994, Hildegard of Bingen.

In 2001 Routledge starred in Anybody's Nightmare, a fact-based television drama in which she played a piano teacher who served four years in prison for murdering her elderly aunt, but was acquitted following a retrial.Routledge's extensive radio credits include several Alan Bennett plays and the BBC dramatisation of Carole Hayman's Ladies of Letters, in which she and Prunella Scales play retired women exchanging humorous correspondence over the course of several years. A tenth series of Ladies of Letters premiered on BBC Radio 4 in 2009.

Radio work prior to 1985 included Private Lives, Present Laughter, The Cherry Orchard, Romeo and Juliet, Alice in Wonderland and The Fountain Overflows.

Having a distinctive voice, Routledge has also recorded and released a variety of audiobooks including unabridged readings of Wuthering Heights and Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and abridged novelisations of the Hetty Wainthropp series.

In 1966, she sang the role of Mad Margaret in Ruddigore, the title role in Iolanthe, and Melissa in Princess Ida, in a series of BBC Radio Gilbert and Sullivan recordings. She took part in a studio broadcast of Tchaikovsky's opera Vakula the Smith (narrating excerpts from the work by Gogol) in 1989. In 2006, she was featured in a programme of the ""Stage and Screen"" series on Radio 3.","1960—Follow That Girl—Original London Cast,1962—Little Mary Sunshine—Original London Cast,1963—Virtue in Danger—Original London Cast,1965—Hello, Dolly!—1965 London Studio Cast (Mrs Irene Malloy),1966—The Sound of Music—1966 London Studio Cast (Mother Abbess),1967—Androcles and the Lion—1967 Television Cast,1967—Kiss Me, Kate—1967 London Studio Cast (Lily/Katherine),1968—Darling of the Day—1968 Original Broadway Cast,1969—A Talent to Amuse: Noel Coward's 70th Birthday Concert—1969 Concert Cast,1972—Cowardy Custard—1972 Original London Cast,1976—Cole—1976 Studio Cast,1985—I Remember Mama—1985 Original Cast Members (Aunt Jenny),1987—An Evening With Alan Jay Lerner—1987 Concert Cast,1973—Presenting Patricia Routledge—Re-released on CD in 1996,","1966—Whitbread Award—Outstanding Musical Performance—How’s The World Treating You?—Won,1968—Tony Award—Best Actress in a Musical—Darling of the Day—Won,1979—Olivier Award—Best Supporting Actress—And a Nightingale Sang...—Nominated,1984—Broadcasting Press Guild Award—Best Actress—A Woman of No Importance—Won,1985—Olivier Award—Best Supporting Performance—Richard III—Nominated,1988—Olivier Award—Best Actress in a Musical—Candide—Won,1989—BAFTA TV Award—Best Actress—Talking Heads: A Lady of Letters''—Nominated,1991—British Comedy Award—Best TV Comedy Actress—Keeping Up Appearances—Won,1992—BAFTA TV Award—Best Light Entertainment Performance—Keeping Up Appearances—Nominated,1992—Olivier Award—Best Actress—Talking Heads—Nominated,1993—BAFTA TV Award—Best Light Entertainment Performance—Keeping up Appearances—Nominated,1993—Variety Club of Great Britain Award—Personality of the Year—Keeping up Appearances—Won,","English actress, comedian and singer",17/1/1929,1952–present,N/A,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Routledge

In June 2010, she married Irish musician Damien O'Kane, with whom she has two children.","Rusby was born into a family of musicians in 1973 in Penistone, West Riding of Yorkshire, England. After learning to play the guitar, the fiddle and the piano, as well as to sing, she played in many local folk festivals as a child and adolescent, before joining (and becoming the lead vocalist of) the all-female Celtic folk band the Poozies. 1995 saw the release of her breakthrough album, Kate Rusby & Kathryn Roberts, a collaboration with her friend and fellow Barnsley folk singer Kathryn Roberts. In 1997, with the help of her family, Rusby recorded and released her first solo album, Hourglass. Since then she has gone on to receive acclaim in her home country and abroad and her family continues to help her with all aspects of her professional career.

Rusby was also a member of the folk group Equation, later to be replaced by Cara Dillon. The early line-up also featured Rusby's erstwhile performing partner Kathryn Roberts and Mercury-nominated artist Seth Lakeman, and his brother, Sean Lakeman. Their first EP, In Session, had a small commercial release and led to them signing a major record deal with WEA.

The previously unreleased song ""Wandering Soul"" was Rusby's contribution to the soundtrack for Billy Connolly's World Tour of New Zealand, an eight-part BBC television documentary series originally broadcast in November 2004.

A collaboration with Ronan Keating saw Rusby riding high in the UK Singles Chart; their duet ""All Over Again"" peaked at No. 6 in June 2006.

Jenny Ryan,N/A,"Ryan's first quiz show appearance was on University Challenge, helping the University of Leeds to reach the semi-finals in 2003. She also appeared on Mastermind in 2006, choosing the American television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer as her specialist subject, and featured in both series of Are You an Egghead? in 2008 and 2009. She found success on Only Connect as a member of the team, The Gamblers, who won the third series of the show in 2010. Additionally, she has made appearances on Fifteen to One and Weakest Link, and worked as a QI Elf.

Ryan wrote questions for the pilot episode of The Chase in 2009. She joined the show as a chaser in 2015, making her debut appearance on 2 September. She was recommended for The Chase by Anne Hegerty, as they had both competed together on the same quiz team, where Ryan was the captain of the team. Her nickname on the show is ""The Vixen"", in reference to her red hair, freckles and ponytail; Bradley Walsh came up with the name and the producers liked it since ""vixens are notoriously clever and cunning"". She is also referred to as ""The Bolton Brainiac"" for her place of birth.

In 2017, she appeared alongside fellow chasers Anne Hegerty, Shaun Wallace and Mark Labbett on Let's Sing and Dance for Comic Relief. They won the competition, performing a Wizard of Oz medley.

In July 2019, Ryan appeared on the 14th series of Celebrity MasterChef. In October 2019, she began competing in The X Factor: Celebrity. While she was initially eliminated before the live shows, criticism of this decision from viewers led to her being asked back to join the live shows.

Rebekah Ryan,N/A,"In 1996, she signed to MCA Records, her debut single, ""You Lift Me Up"" was released and was well reviewed, and a big national club hit in the UK. The single also reached the Top 40 in the UK Singles Chart.

The follow-up, ""Just A Little Bit of Love"" was not so well received by critics. Of note, Smash Hits, reviewing the single, declared that ""Rebekah may be as cute as a box of Andrex puppies, but even that shouldn't help this duffer of a dance single into the charts"". Nevertheless, it was a sizeable club success, and like its predecessor, was produced by the popular dance outfit, K-Klass. However, the single failed to reach the Top 40, peaking at number 51 in the UK. Celine Dion also sang the song. Rebekah performed this song on her support act slot, with Boyzone, on their concurrent tour.

Early in 1997, ""Woman in Love"" was released to mixed reviews. It was a cover version of the Barbra Streisand hit. ""Woman in Love"" was essentially a ballad with hip hop and R&B undertones. The track did not sell well, entering the charts at number 64 and disappearing from the chart the following week. Ryan did have an album in the pipeline and said to be forthcoming in the media around the time of this single's release. It was due for release in mid-1997 However, it was decided not to release it, due to Ryan's previous two singles failing to emulate the success of her debut. It is known that (as well as the three singles), the following tracks were recorded for this album: ""Fallen"" (produced by Steve Anderson of Brothers in Rhythm (who has actually seemingly himself posted the track on YouTube, to enthusiastic praise from viewers); ""Swept Away"" (a mid-tempo love song), ""The Feeling Is Right Now"" (produced, like ""Fallen"", by Steve Anderson, and written by Lulu), and ""Nothing in This World"", written by none other than Burt Bacharach and 1990s pop-R&B luminary Nigel Lowis (who worked extensively with Eternal, Dina Carroll and Michelle Gayle). These three tracks remain virtually unheard and totally unreleased. Additionally, on the B-Side to ""You Lift Me Up"" was a cover of ""Have I Told You Lately"", which may or may not have appeared on Ryan's LP. Another track, ""Just Can't Learn To Say Goodbye"", from this album, appears on the music website SoundCloud.

In 2001, with a new recording contract, Ryan re-emerged with a totally different sound, style and image. Whereas before, her material had been dance-pop/soul, it was now rock-pop. Her album, Big Trouble (Lots of Fun) was released by Jive Records, despite the absence of a hit single to promote it. The album sold poorly. The lead single, ""You Think You Got The Right"", benefited from good reviews and promotion, but did not reach the UK Singles Chart. In 2002, still on Jive Records, Ryan released a re-edited version of the album, this time entitled I'll Live, and featuring another new single, ""Can I Depend on You?""; neither release charted. The album, complete with new artwork, also omitted a few of the prior LP's tracks, yet added some more ones.

In 2007, Ryan was selected as one of the 12 finalists in the Over 25s category group on the ITV show, The X Factor. She returned to the programme in 2016, the judges put her through to boot camp.","Year—Title—1996—""You Lift Me Up""—26,""Just A Little Bit of Love""—51—1996,1997—""Woman in Love""—64,2001—""You Think You Got The Right""—109,2002—""Can I Depend on You?"",2016—""What I Need"",

Carolyn Sampson,N/A,"Born in Bedford, she studied music at the Birmingham University. During her studies, she performed as a member of the choir Ex Cathedra, winning an Arnold Goldsbrough Prize for Baroque music. She made her operatic debut singing the part of Amore in Monteverdi's L'incoronazione di Poppea at the English National Opera.

Rina Sawayama,"Sawayama was born on 16 August 1990 in Niigata, Japan. She lived there until the age of five, when her family decided to move to London, where she was raised and currently resides. She holds an indefinite leave to remain (ILR) visa in the UK.

While studying politics, psychology and sociology at Magdalene College, Cambridge, Sawayama decided to pursue music and modelling. During her time at university, she performed in a hip-hop group called Lazy Lion with Theo Ellis from the indie rock band Wolf Alice. She graduated from the university with a degree in political science. In May 2020, Sawayama said that she was doing an online course at the University of Oxford.","Sawayama began her solo career in February 2013, with the single ""Sleeping in Waking"", produced by Justin ""Hoost"" Tailor. A 7-inch vinyl of the single, featuring a new song titled ""Who?"" as the B-side, was released in April 2013 through UK label Make Mine. Later that year, she released the single ""Terror"" on Halloween under the stage name of ""Riina"". Sawayama would later reveal in a 2021 Billboard interview that the reason she used only her first name is because her last name was ""an inconvenience"".

In June 2015, she released a music video, directed by Arvida Byström, to her track ""Tunnel Vision"". In 2016, she released the single ""Where U Are"", with an accompanying music video co-directed by Alessandra Kurr. The single explored human interaction with digital media, with Sawayama explaining: ""Online, you can present your best edited self [and] your overheating phone substitutes human warmth. Weirdest of all – you're together, but also very alone."" The song has been described as ""nostalgic greatness… ultra-sweet and shimmering pop"", and ""90s R&B pop perfection"".In March 2017, her single ""Cyber Stockholm Syndrome"" premiered on The Fader. Sawayama described the genesis of the themes of the track as: ""the digital world can offer vital support networks, voices of solidarity, refuge, escape. That's what 'Cyber Stockholm Syndrome' is about: pessimism, optimism, anxiety, and freedom.""

In 2017, the singles ""Alterlife"" and ""Tunnel Vision"", a duet with Shamir, were released, followed by her debut EP Rina. Sawayama was then an unsigned artist, and Rina was released independently; she confirmed on Twitter that she worked for two to three years to save money to release the EP. The Guardian deemed the EP ""bracing and modern"", stating that Sawayama had proven ""she can shepherd pop into the future, too"". Pitchfork ranked Rina in its list of best pop and R&B albums of the year. In 2018, Sawayama released the single ""Valentine"" on Valentine's Day. The music video for album track ""Ordinary Superstar"" was released in June 2018. In August 2018, Sawayama released the track ""Cherry"", in which she explores her sexual identity. Sawayama embarked on her Ordinary Superstar Tour across the UK, the US and Canada in late 2018. In 2019, she performed as the supporting act for Charli XCX's tour across the UK.In 2020, after signing to Dirty Hit records, Sawayama released the singles ""STFU!"", a nu-metal, heavy metal, pop and avant-pop song, and ""Comme des Garçons (Like the Boys)"", a ""homage to early 2000s dance tracks"", both from her then-upcoming debut album. A third single, the rock and 2000s R&B-inspired ""XS"", was released on 2 March. The following month, Sawayama released another single from the album titled ""Chosen Family"". Her debut album, Sawayama, was released on 17 April to widespread critical acclaim. On 29 June 2020, she released a cover of the Grammy-nominated Lady Gaga song, ""Dance in the Dark"" (2009) as part of Spotify's Singles series. The song was recorded in Sawayama's home studio and is an electropop composition with production handled by Clarence Clarity, her version replacing the Europop sound of the original song with nu-metal-influenced electropop.

In late July 2020, Sawayama made a public tweet about her ineligibility to be nominated for major British music awards, such as the Mercury Prize and BRIT Awards, due to the fact that she does not hold British citizenship. The hashtag ""#SawayamaIsBritish"" became trending on Twitter in the UK shortly after. Sawayama's movement gained major support from Elton John online, who wrote that he was ""happy to hear that the [ BPI] are reviewing the rules that led to Rina Sawayama's well-deserved album being snubbed from this year's [ Mercury Prize] list of nominees."" The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) later changed the rules to allow anyone who had remained in the UK, including her, to be eligible.

On 26 October 2020, Sawayama made her television debut performing the song ""XS"" on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. The following month, she released a song titled ""Lucid"", produced by BloodPop. On 4 December 2020, a deluxe version of Sawayama was released.

In April 2021, Sawayama released an updated version of her song ""Chosen Family"", as a duet with Elton John. The following month, Sawayama was cast in an undisclosed role in the fourth installment in the John Wick film series. In August 2021, Sawayama was included on Newsweek Japan ""100 Japanese people respected by the world"" list. Sawayama contributed a cover of the Metallica song ""Enter Sandman"" to the charity tribute album The Metallica Blacklist, released in September 2021.","Title—Details—JPN Dig.—SCO—UK—UK Indie—US Current—US Heat—US Indie,Sawayama—* Released: 17 April 2020 * Label: Dirty Hit * Formats: Digital download, streaming, 12″ vinyl, CD, cassette—65—24—80—5—82—6—43,Title—Details—Peak chart positions,Title—Details—Rina—* Released: 27 October 2017 * Label: Self-released/Dirty Hit * Formats: Digital download, streaming, 12″ vinyl—40,Sawayama Remixed—* Released: 27 November 2020 * Label: Dirty Hit, Rough Trade * Formats: 12″ vinyl,Title—Year—UK DL—NZ Hot—Album,""Sleeping in Waking""—2013—Non-album singles,""Terror"" (as Riina)—2013—Non-album singles,""Tunnel Vision""—2015—Non-album singles,""Where U Are""—2016—Non-album singles,""This Time Last Year""—2016—Non-album singles,""Cyber Stockholm Syndrome""—2017—Rina,""Alterlife""—2017—Rina,""Tunnel Vision"" (featuring Shamir)—2017—Rina,""Valentine (What's It Gonna Be)""—2018—Non-album single,""Ordinary Superstar""—2018—Rina,""Cherry""—2018—Non-album singles,""Flicker""—2018—Non-album singles,""STFU!""—2019—Sawayama,""Comme des Garçons (Like the Boys)"" (solo or Brabo remix featuring Pabllo Vittar)—2020—Sawayama,""XS"" (solo or remix featuring Bree Runway)—2020—Sawayama,""Chosen Family""—2020—Sawayama,""Bad Friend""—2020—Sawayama,""Lucid""—2020—Sawayama (Deluxe Edition),""Chosen Family"" (with Elton John)—2021—62—24—Sawayama (Deluxe Edition) and The Lockdown Sessions,""—"" denotes items which were not released in that country or failed to chart.,""Dance in the Dark"" (Spotify Singles)—2020—Sawayama Remixed,""Enter Sandman""—2021—The Metallica Blacklist,Title—Year—Peak chart positions—Album,Title—Year—""Free Woman (Clarence Clarity Remix)"" (Lady Gaga featuring Rina Sawayama)—Album—2021—20—Dawn of Chromatica,","AIM Independent Music Awards—2021—International Breakthrough—Herself—Pending,Attitude Awards—2020—Breakthrough Award—Herself—Won,BRIT Awards—2021—Rising Star—Herself—Nominated,British LGBT Awards—2021—Best Music Artist—Herself—Pending,Denmark GAFFA Awards—2021—Best International New Act—Herself—Nominated,Denmark GAFFA Awards—2021—Best International Solo Act—Nominated—Herself,Denmark GAFFA Awards—2021—Best International Album—Sawayama—Nominated,Gay Times Honours—2021—British Excellence in Music—Herself—Won,Gold Derby Music Awards—2021—Album Of The Year—Sawayama—Nominated,Gold Derby Music Awards—2021—Best New Artist—Herself—Nominated,Gold Derby Music Awards—2021—Best Rock/Alternative Artist—Herself—Nominated,Golden Indie Music Awards—2020—Asian Songwriter Award—Herself—Nominated,GLAAD Media Awards—2021—Outstanding Breakthrough Artist—Sawayama—Nominated,Independent Music Companies Association—2020—European Independent Album of the Year—Sawayama—Nominated,Music Week Awards—2021—Artist Marketing Campaign—Herself—Pending,Rober Awards Music Prize—2020—Best New Artist—Herself—Won,Rober Awards Music Prize—2020—Best Pop Artist—Nominated—Herself,Rober Awards Music Prize—2020—Song of the Year—""XS""—Nominated,Rober Awards Music Prize—2020—Best Music Video—""Bad Friend""—Nominated,The Daily Californian Art Awards—2020—Best International Album—Sawayama—Won,Vogue Japan—2019—Women of the Year—Herself—Won,",Japanese-British singer-songwriter and model,16/7/1990,N/A,N/A,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rina_Sawayama

Naomi Scott,"Naomi Grace Scott was born on 6 May 1993 in Hounslow, London. She is of English and Ugandan-Indian descent. Her mother, Usha Scott (née Joshi), who was born in Uganda and immigrated to the United Kingdom at a young age, is of Indian Gujarati descent, while her father, Christopher Scott, is English. Scott also has an older brother, Joshua.

At eight years old, she and her family moved to Woodford, London, where both of her parents were pastors at the Bridge Church. She grew up listening to gospel and R&B music, specifically singers Kim Burrell, Mary Mary and Kirk Franklin, and singing in church. She attended Davenant Foundation School in Loughton, Essex. She left the school halfway through taking her A-Levels in order to pursue her role in Terra Nova.","Scott was discovered by British pop singer Kéllé Bryan from the girl group Eternal, who signed her as a client. She went to work with British songwriters and producers Xenomania. In 2014, the YouTube channel ""Reload"" published two videos featuring her, as part of their ""Reload Sessions"" series.

Her first major acting role was a Disney Channel UK series Life Bites. In 2010, she was cast as Mohini ""Mo"" Banjaree in the 2011 Disney Channel original film Lemonade Mouth, her first role in an American production. That same year she was cast as Maddy Shannon in the science-fiction series Terra Nova, which premiered in September 2011 on Fox. The series was not renewed for a second season. In 2013, Scott appeared in the music video for the song ""Hurricane"", by her Lemonade Mouth co-star Bridgit Mendler. In August 2014, she independently released her debut EP Invisible Division. Scott was cast as Ryoko in Ridley Scott's The Martian. She filmed her scenes but most of them were removed from the final cut, effectively making her an ""extra"" in the film. Screen International selected Scott as one of their 2015 Stars of Tomorrow. In October, she was cast in a co-leading role as Kimberly Hart, the Pink Ranger, in Power Rangers (2017), a film adaptation of the TV series of the same name. The film was released on 24 March 2017, and earned Scott a Teen Choice Award nomination. The film was met with mixed reviews upon release and was a box office disappointment, grossing $142 million worldwide against a budget of $105 million.

In 2019, Scott starred as Princess Jasmine in Aladdin, a live-action adaptation of Disney's 1992 animated film of the same name. Scott's casting over a ""Middle Eastern or Arab actress"" generated controversy. In his review for the San Francisco Chronicle, critic Mick LaSalle found Scott to be the ""real star"" of the film and that she ""thrives and gives everything to her new power anthem ['Speechless']"". Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times wrote that Scott ""absolutely sparkles"" in her performance of ""Speechless"". For her role, Scott won the Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress – Sci-Fi/Fantasy and also received a nomination for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress. Aladdin was also commercially successful, grossing $1 billion at the box office.

Also in 2019, Scott starred as one of the three leads in the action comedy Charlie's Angels, the third installment within the franchise of the same name, released in November. The film received mixed reviews from critics. She will appear in the science fiction film Distant. She is also attached to star as a ""parliamentary researcher"" in the web television anthology series Anatomy of a Scandal.","Invisible Division—* Release date: 25 August 2014 * Format: Digital download * Label: Independent,Promises—* Release date: 5 August 2016 * Format: Digital download * Label: Independent,As main artist

Louise Setara,"Setara was born in Reading, England, where she was homeschooled by her mother, Lorraine. She decided at the age of seven that she wanted to become a professional singer, when a member of The Drifters performed at a wedding she was attending and invited her on stage to sing ""My Girl"" with him.","Setara was signed up at the age of 15 by producer Kwame Kwaten, who spotted her at a talent contest.

The album was chosen as 'Album of the Week' by BBC Radio 2 in January 2007.

Her debut single, ""Can't Stop the River"" was released in the UK on 27 November 2006 without a music video. Unknown to her, it was also given to Duncan James and Guy Sebastian to record. She eventually released her original recording of the song after both artists had released their versions of ""Can't Stop the River"", re-titled ""Can't Stop a River"".

She supported Lionel Richie on his UK tour in 2007.

A download-only single, ""Wrong Again"", was released on 29 January 2007, and as a full single later in 2007.

Nadine Shah,"In November 2019, along with 34 other musicians, Shah signed a letter endorsing the Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in the 2019 UK general election with a call to end austerity. In 2020, she voiced her support for the newly-elected Labour Party leader Keir Starmer.","Her debut album, the Ben Hillier-produced Love Your Dum and Mad, was largely inspired by the tragic deaths of two young men. ""There are two boys that this album is predominantly about,"" she continues. ""During the period of time these songs were written two very close friends took their own lives."" Shah is a keen speaker on the subject of social stigmas towards those suffering from mental health illnesses.

Shah and Hillier released their second record titled Fast Food in April 2015. She also made a guest appearance on two tracks of Ghostpoet's album, Shedding Skin, which was released in March 2015.

The fourth studio album Kitchen Sink came out on 26 June 2020 and found much acclaim of critics. In some of the lyrics she considers what it means to be a thirtysomething woman today.

Shah provided testimony to the UK government's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee as part of an ongoing probe into the economics of music streaming in November 2020, citing a lack of transparency regarding musicians' royalty payments.","Albums

Lucie Silvas,"Born in Kingston upon Thames, England, her father is from New Zealand and is of Jewish descent; and her mother is Scottish and is Christian. Silvas has two sisters, Mia (who has performed backing vocals for her), and Nikki. Her parents were also big music lovers and Silvas has stated this inspired her career, besides the fact that her mother was an opera singer and wanted to pursue a career in music herself.

Silvas learned to play piano at the age of 5, and had written her first song by age 10. She relocated many times between her parents' native countries as well as England. Her family moved to Thames Ditton, Surrey, England, when she was 13. She entered a Jewish Care Young Performer competition and came in third when she was 14. She attended Surbiton High School for Girls and left at 16 before going to Brooklands College, in Weybridge, Surrey.

After leaving college at the age of 18, Silvas became a backing singer for Judie Tzuke, who helped her write much of her first album, entitled Breathe In.","In 2000, Silvas signed to EMI Records. In June 2000, she released her debut single, ""It's Too Late"", which peaked at No. 62 in the UK Singles Chart. An album, entitled Forget Me Not, was also planned for release but EMI terminated her contract after the poor reception of the single.

In 2001, Chrysalis Records (an EMI subsidiary) contacted her, this time for songwriting. She signed a publishing contract and, despite being without a record label to release her music, she continued writing and had songs recorded and released by British artists including Sarah Whatmore, Will Young, Gareth Gates, Rachel Stevens and Liberty X. Several of Silvas' songs for other artists have become chart hits.In 2003, Silvas recorded a duet with the Spanish singer Natalia called ""This Time"", and in 2004 she also wrote the first single off Natalia's third album, entitled ""Sombras"" (Shadows). The same year, Silvas also wrote ""I'm Not Your Girlfriend"" for the Spanish singer Cristie.

In 2003, Silvas signed a recording contract of her own with Mercury Records. She recorded her second album, Breathe In, which was to become her official debut album in October 2004. Produced by Mike Peden, much of Breathe In was co-written with Judie Tzuke, for whom Silvas sang backing vocals for many years. BBC Radio 2 commissioned a radio show to track Silvas' development in the music industry, supporting her career, and adding her tracks to their playlist. The first single from the album, What You're Made of, entered the official UK charts at number 7, and the following week the album debuted and peaked at number 11 (returning to this position in early 2005). Following TV appearances on the Ivor Novello Elton John tribute show, and ""All Time Greatest Love Songs"" with Ronan Keating, Silvas released her second single from the album, ""Breathe In"", which debuted at number 6, her highest UK chart peak to date. Silvas then released further singles; ""The Game Is Won"" and ""Don't Look Back"" which peaked at numbers 38 and 34 respectively.

Following the release of the ""Breathe In"" single in Britain, Silvas took her music to Europe, including Germany and the Netherlands, where she released a special Europe-only single, ""Nothing Else Matters"", a cover of the Metallica song. The Breathe In album was also re-released in the Netherlands as a special 2-disc edition, featuring a full live concert recorded there. She also re-recorded ""What You're Made Of"" for the Spanish and French markets, working with Antonio Orozco and Grégory Lemarchal respectively. A special re-recorded version of the song, featuring the Metropole Orchestra, was released as the fourth and final single from the album in the Netherlands.

With Breathe In certified Platinum in the UK, Silvas embarked on her second UK tour starting in Brighton on 2 November 2005.

Silvas's second album, The Same Side, was recorded in 2006. Produced by Danton Supple (who had produced Coldplay's X&Y album), it was released first in the Netherlands in October 2006. A duet with Marco Borsato, ""Everytime I Think of You"", was released as the first single in the Netherlands, charting at No. 35 on downloads only, and topping the Dutch Top 40 in the next 3 weeks, becoming her first Number 1 single. A DVD of The Same Side has also been released in the Netherlands.

""Last Year"" was the first single from the album in the UK and Ireland, premiering on BBC Radio 2 in late August 2006, though it failed to chart. Following this setback, Mercury Records decided to postpone the UK release of the album, which had been scheduled for October 2006. A second single, ""Sinking In"", was released as a download only single on 5 March 2007 in the United Kingdom and Ireland, though this too failed to chart. The album was finally released in the UK on 12 March 2007, charting at No. 62 on the UK Albums Chart in its first week before falling out of the Top 100 the following week.After The Same Side failed to impact on the charts, Silvas was subsequently dropped by her label. She has spent time working on new music in Nashville, Tennessee and New York City, as well as in studios in the UK. Several demos have been recorded and posted to various sites on the internet such as Silvas' official Myspace page. In August 2009, Silvas revealed that she was writing with Australian singer Delta Goodrem, and has also co-written tracks for Katharine McPhee's album Unbroken. In September 2009, Silvas also told fans on Twitter she was working on getting new material out in 2010 and was also planning a European tour. In February 2010, Silvas spent some time in the studio with Nadine Coyle of Girls Aloud.

In February 2011, Silvas revealed content from her then-forthcoming album, Letters to Ghosts.

Siouxsie Sioux,"Siouxsie was born Susan Janet Ballion on 27 May 1957 at Guy's Hospital in Southwark, England. She is ten years younger than her two siblings. Her brother and sister were born while the family was in the Belgian Congo. Her parents met in that colony and worked there for a few years. Her mother, Betty, was of Scottish and English descent and was a secretary who spoke both French and English. Her father was a bacteriologist who milked venom from snakes, and hailed from Wallonia, the French-speaking part of Belgium. In the mid-1950s, before Siouxsie's birth, the family moved to England.

The Ballions lived in a suburban district in Chislehurst, Kent. Siouxsie was an isolated child, being unable to invite friends to her house due to her alcoholic, unemployed father. Despite his issues, Siouxsie regarded him as intelligent and well-read, and sympathised with his inability to fit in with a ""rigid, middle-class society"". During moments of sobriety, her father shared with her his love for books. Siouxsie was aware that her family was different; the Ballions were not involved in the local community and Siouxsie, aware that her family's house differed from the neighbours', would later state that ""the suburbs inspired intense hatred.""

At the age of nine, she and a friend were sexually assaulted by a stranger. The assault was ignored by both her parents and the police, and was not spoken of in the family. The incident and its later treatment would lead Siouxsie to distrust adults. Years later, she stated: ""I grew up having no faith in adults as responsible people. And being the youngest in the family I was isolated – I had no one to confide in. So I invented my own world, my own reality. It was my own way of defending myself – protecting myself from the outside world. The only way I could deal with how to survive was to get some strong armour.""

Her father died of alcoholism-related illness when Siouxsie was 14 years old, resulting in a decline in her health. Siouxsie lost considerable weight and missed school. After several misdiagnoses, she was operated on and survived a bout of ulcerative colitis. During the weeks of recovery in mid-1972, she watched television in the hospital and saw David Bowie on Top of the Pops.

At 17, she left school. It was during this period that she began frequenting the local gay discos where her sister's friends went. She introduced later her own friends to that scene. In November 1975, the Sex Pistols performed at the local art college in Chislehurst. Siouxsie did not attend, but one of her friends told her how they sounded like the Stooges, and that singer Johnny Rotten had threatened students attending the gig. In February 1976, Siouxsie and her friend Steven Severin went to see the Sex Pistols play in London. After chatting with members of the band, Siouxsie and Severin decided to follow them regularly. In the following months, journalist Caroline Coon coined the term ""Bromley Contingent"" to describe this group of eccentric teenagers devoted to the Sex Pistols.

Siouxsie became well known in the London club scene for her glam, fetish- and bondage-inspired attire, which later became part of punk fashion. She would also heavily influence the later development of gothic fashion with her signature cat-eye makeup, deep red lipstick, spiky dyed-black hair, and black clothing. In early September 1976, the Bromley Contingent followed the Sex Pistols to France, where Siouxsie was beaten up for wearing a cupless bra and a black armband with a swastika on it. She claimed her intent was to shock the bourgeoisie, not to make a political statement. She later wrote the song ""Metal Postcard (Mittageisen)"" (in memory of the anti-Nazi artist John Heartfield).

Following the DIY ethos and the idea that the people in the audience could be the people on stage, Siouxsie and Severin decided to form a band. When a support slot at the 100 Club Punk Festival (organised by Malcolm McLaren) opened up, they decided to make an attempt at performing, although at that time they did not know how to play any songs. On 20 September 1976, the band improvised 20 minutes of music while Siouxsie sang the ""Lord's Prayer"".

For critic Jon Savage, Siouxsie was ""unlike any female singer before or since, commanding yet aloof, entirely modern"". Viv Albertine from the Slits said: ""Siouxsie just appeared fully made, fully in control, utterly confident. It totally blew me away. There she was doing something that I dared to dream but she took it and did it and it wiped the rest of the festival for me, that was it. I can't even remember everything else about it except that one performance.""

One of Siouxsie's first public appearances was with the Sex Pistols on Bill Grundy's television show, on Thames Television in December 1976. Standing next to the band, Siouxsie made fun of the presenter when he asked her how she was doing. She responded: ""I've always wanted to meet you, Bill."" Grundy, who claimed he was drunk, suggested a meeting after the show, which provoked guitarist Steve Jones to respond with a series of expletives, never heard before on early-evening television. This episode created a media furore on the front covers of several tabloids, including the Daily Mirror, which published the headline ""Siouxsie's a Punk Shocker"". The event had a major impact on the Sex Pistols' subsequent career, and they became a household name overnight.

Aware of the press surrounding both herself and the Sex Pistols, Siouxsie began to distance herself from the scene and stopped seeing Sex Pistols shows, instead focusing her energy on her own band, Siouxsie and the Banshees.In 1977, Siouxsie began touring in England as Siouxsie and the Banshees. One year later, their first single, ""Hong Kong Garden"", reached number 7 in the UK Singles Chart; With its oriental-inflected xylophone motif, Melody Maker deemed it ""a glorious debut [...] All the elements come together with remarkable effect. The song is strident and powerful with tantalising oriental guitar riffs plus words and vocals that are the result of anger, disdain and isolation. No-one will be singled out because everyone is part and parcel of the whole. It might even be a hit"".

Their debut album, The Scream, was one of the first post-punk records released. It received 5-star reviews in Sounds and Record Mirror. The latter said that the record ""points to the future, real music for the new age"". The music was different from the single; it was angular, dark and jagged. The Scream was later hailed by NME as one of the best debut albums of all time along with Patti Smith's Horses. Join Hands followed in 1979 with war as the lyrical theme.

The 1980 album Kaleidoscope marked a change in musical direction with the arrival of John McGeoch, considered ""one of the most innovative and influential guitarists"" by The Guardian, and drummer Budgie, the latter of whom would continue to perform and record with Siouxsie throughout her career until 2004. The hit single ""Happy House"" was qualified as ""great Pop"" with ""liquid guitar"" and other songs like ""Red Light"" were layered with electronic sounds. Kaleidoscope widened Siouxsie's audience, reaching the top 5 in the UK charts. Juju followed in 1981, reaching number 7; the singles ""Spellbound"" and ""Arabian Knights"" were described as ""pop marvels"" by The Guardian. During recording sessions for Juju, Siouxsie and Budgie formed a percussion-oriented duo called the Creatures, characterized by a stripped-down sound focused on vocals and drums; their first record, the EP Wild Things, was a commercial success.

In 1982, the Siouxsie and the Banshees' album A Kiss in the Dreamhouse was widely acclaimed by critics. Richard Cook of NME depicted it as ""a feat of imagination scarcely ever recorded"". The single ""Slowdive"" was ""a violin-colored dance beat number"". They included strings for the first time on several songs. However, the recording sessions took their toll, and McGeoch was forced to quit the band.

In 1983, Siouxsie went to Hawaii to record the Creatures' first album, Feast, which included the hit single ""Miss the Girl"". It was her first incursion into exotica, incorporating sounds of waves, local Hawaiian choirs and local percussions. Later that year, Siouxsie and Budgie released ""Right Now"", a song from Mel Tormé's repertoire that the Creatures re-orchestrated with brass arrangements; ""Right Now"" soon became a top 20 hit single in the UK. Then, with the Banshees (including guitarist Robert Smith of the Cure), she covered the Beatles' ""Dear Prudence"", which reached number 3 on the UK Singles Chart. Two albums followed with Smith: Nocturne, recorded live in London in 1983, and 1984's Hyæna. In 1985, the single ""Cities in Dust"" was recorded with sequencers; it climbed to number 21 in the UK charts. Entertainment Weekly noted that it was the first of a handful of Alternative rock radio hits in the U.S. 1986's Tinderbox and the 1987 covers album Through the Looking Glass both reached the top 15 in the UK.

In 1988, the single ""Peek-a-Boo"" marked a musical departure from her previous work, anticipating hip hop-inspired rock with the use of samples. The song was praised by NME as ""oriental marching band hip hop with farting horns and catchy accordion"" and hailed by Melody Maker as ""a brightly unexpected mixture of black steel and pop disturbance"". The Peepshow album received a five star review in Q magazine. The ballad ""The Last Beat of My Heart"" issued as a single, saw her exploring new ground with accordion and strings.

Siouxsie and Budgie then went to Andalusia in Spain to record the second Creatures album, Boomerang. The songs took a different direction from previous Creatures works, with backing music ranging from flamenco to jazz and blues styles. It featured brass on most of the songs. The first single was ""Standing There"". NME hailed Boomerang as ""a rich and unsettling landscape of exotica"". Anton Corbijn visited the group during the recording near Jerez de la Frontera, and Siouxsie convinced him to take photographs in color, unlike his prior work which was in black-and-white: the photos used for the promotion showed Siouxsie and Budgie in fields surrounded with sunflowers. In 1990, she toured for the first time with the Creatures, in Europe and North America.

On 1991's dance-oriented ""Kiss Them for Me"" single, Siouxsie and the Banshees used South Asian instrumentation, which had become popular in the UK club scene with the growth of bhangra. Indian tabla player Talvin Singh (who was later Björk's percussionist on her 1993 Debut album) took part in the session and provided vocals for the bridge. With Kiss Them for Me, the Banshees scored a hit on the US Billboard Hot 100 peaking at number 23. After the release of Superstition which received enthusiastic reviews, the group co-headlined the first Lollapalooza tour, further increasing their American following.

In 1992, film director Tim Burton requested that she write a song for Batman Returns, and the Banshees composed the single ""Face to Face"".

In the mid-1990s, Siouxsie started to do one-off collaborations with other artists. Suede invited her to a benefit concert for the Red Hot Organization. With guitarist Bernard Butler, she performed a version of Lou Reed's ""Caroline Says"". Spin reviewed it as ""haughty and stately"". Morrissey, ex-lead singer of the Smiths, recorded a duet with Siouxsie in 1994. They both sang on the single ""Interlude"", a track that was initially performed by Timi Yuro, a female torch singer of the 1960s. ""Interlude"" was released under the name of ""Morrissey and Siouxsie"".

The last Banshees studio album, The Rapture, was released in 1995; it was written partly in the Toulouse area of France, where she had recently moved. After the accompanying tour, the Banshees announced their split during a press conference called ""20 Minutes into 20 Years"". The Creatures de facto became her only band. At the same time, she released the song ""The Lighthouse"" on French producer Hector Zazou's album Chansons des mers froides (which translates to Songs from the Cold Seas), with jazz trumpetist Mark Isham. Siouxsie and Zazou adapted the poem ""Flannan Isle"" by English poet Wilfred Wilson Gibson.

Her first live performance in three years was in February 1998 when former Velvet Underground member John Cale invited her to a festival called ""With a Little Help From My Friends"" at the Paradiso in Amsterdam. The concert was shown on Dutch national television and featured an unreleased Creatures composition, ""Murdering Mouth"", sung as a duet with Cale. The collaboration between the two artists worked so well that they decided to tour the US from June until August, performing ""Murdering Mouth"", and Cale's ""Gun"" together as the encores of a Creatures and Cale double bill.

The following year, Siouxsie and Budgie released Anima Animus, the first Creatures album since the split of the Banshees. It included the singles ""2nd Floor"" and ""Prettiest Thing"". The material diverged from their former work, with a more urban sound blending art rock and electronica. Anima Animus was described by The Times as ""hypnotic and inventive"". Also in 1999, Siouxsie collaborated with Marc Almond on the track ""Threat of Love"".

In 2002, she was rated as one of the 10 best female rock artists by Q. That same year, Universal released The Best of Siouxsie and the Banshees as the first reissue of her back catalogue.

In 2003, Siouxsie and Budgie released the last Creatures album, Hái!, which was in part recorded in Japan, collaborating with taiko player Leonard Eto (previously of the Kodo Drummers). Peter Wratts wrote in Time Out: ""Her voice is the dominant instrument here, snaking and curling around the bouncing drumming backdrop, elegiac and inhuman as she chants, purrs and whispers her way around the album"". He termed the record a ""spine-tingling achievement"". Hái! was preceded by the single ""Godzilla!"". That year, Siouxsie was featured on the track ""Cish Cash"" by Basement Jaxx, from their album Kish Kash, which later won Best Electronic/Dance Album at the Grammy Awards.

2004 was a pivotal year for the singer. She toured for the first time as a solo act combining Banshees and Creatures songs. A live DVD called Dreamshow was recorded at the last London concert, in which she and her musicians were accompanied by a 16-piece orchestra, the Millennia Ensemble. Released in August 2005, this DVD reached the number 1 position in the UK music DVD charts.

Her first solo album, Mantaray, was released in September 2007. Pitchfork wrote, ""She really is pop"", before finishing the review by declaring, ""It's a success"". Mojo stated: ""a thirst for sonic adventure radiates from each track"". Mantaray included three singles: ""Into a Swan"", ""Here Comes That Day"" and ""About to Happen"". In 2008, Siouxsie performed vocals for the track ""Careless Love"" on The Edge of Love soundtrack by composer Angelo Badalamenti, a frequent collaborator with director David Lynch. She performed another Badalamenti number, ""Who Will Take My Dreams Away"", at the annual edition of the World Soundtrack Awards. After a year of touring, the singer played the last show of her tour in London in September 2008. A live DVD of this performance, Finale: The Last Mantaray & More Show, was released in 2009.

In June 2013, after a hiatus of five years, Siouxsie played two nights at the Royal Festival Hall in London during Yoko Ono's Meltdown festival. She performed 1980's Kaleidoscope album live in its entirety, along with other works from her back catalogue, and her performance was hailed by the press. She also appeared at Ono's Double Fantasy concert, to sing the final song, ""Walking on Thin Ice"".

In October 2014, she and fellow Banshee Steven Severin compiled a CD titled It's a Wonderfull Life for the November 2014 issue of Mojo magazine, in which she appeared on the cover. The disc included 15 tracks that inspired the Banshees.

""Love Crime"", her first song in eight years, was featured in the finale of the TV series Hannibal, broadcast in August 2015. The song was then included on both CD and vinyl editions of Hannibal Season 3 – Volume 2. In August 2021, Siouxsie has relaunched her official website.",N/A,"Year—Album details—Peak chart positions,Year—Album details—UK—FRA,2007—Mantaray * Release date: 10 September 2007 * Label: Universal Records—39—132,Year—Single—2007—Album—""Into a Swan""—59—Mantaray,""Here Comes That Day""—93—2007—Mantaray,2008—""About to Happen""—154—Mantaray,2015—""Love Crime""—single only,Year—Single—Artist—Peak positions—Album,Year—Single—Artist—1994—Album—""Interlude""—Morrissey & Siouxsie—25—Non-album song,

Faryl Smith,"Smith was born in Kettering, Northamptonshire, England, on 23 July 1995. She was a student at Southfield School for Girls. where she completed her GCSEs in 2011, and she studied for her A levels, with the intention of going to university afterwards. In 2015, aged 20, she started to study music at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. Faryl is now on the opera course at The Guildhall.","Before her appearance on television, Smith had performed competitively in the Kettering, Northamptonshire Eisteddfod, the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod, the Pontins Junior Starquest competition, and Festival 4 Stars. She auditioned for the second series of the ITV reality television programme Britain's Got Talent, giving what Jon O'Brien, of Allmusic, called a ""mature"" performance of ""Ave Maria"", and was put through to the live shows. Simon Cowell described her audition as ""the best audition [he had] heard in years"". Before performing live, she and Andrew Johnston were favourites to win. She won her semi-final by the public vote, performing a cover of Sarah McLachlan's ""Angel"". This placed her in the final, and left her as the favourite to win. During her first live show, Cowell described her as ""literally one in a million"". She then performed in the live final. She again performed ""Ave Maria"", but finished outside the top three. Sampson eventually won the show as a result of the phone-in, with Signature second, and Johnston third. As a result of her final performance of ""Ave Maria"", Smith was invited to be a guest singer at a songwriting awards ceremony in London. She then went on to perform in the Britain's Got Talent Live Tour with other contestants, where she first performed a duet of ""Walking in the Air"" with Johnston.

While Smith was competing in Britain's Got Talent, Cowell arranged for her to receive singing lessons from the leading vocal coach Yvie Burnett, who had previously coached Paul Potts, an earlier winner of Britain's Got Talent, as well as Leona Lewis, a winner of The X Factor. The story was broken by The Sunday Mirror; writing for the paper, Lara Gould characterised the lessons as ""secret"". During her participation in the competition, Smith was offered record deals, but she and her family turned them down. Her father, Tony Smith, said ""We have had offers from people interested in Faryl. But when Simon Cowell, the big man, says your daughter is special, you listen."" Cowell described Smith's potential career during the show, saying ""I know she says Katherine  is her idol but she is far better than her. She is by far the most talented youngster I've ever heard. When she opens her mouth her voice is just incredible.""The day after the Britain's Got Talent finals, Max Clifford, speaking for Simon Cowell, said that it was ""quite possible"" that Cowell would be signing some of the finalists, including Smith. Though she did not sign with Syco, Cowell's record label, she did record a duet of ""Walking in the Air"" with Johnston, which appeared on his debut album, One Voice. Before the release of One Voice, it was revealed that Smith and her father were finalising the details of her record deal. In November, it was announced that Smith would be performing on stage in Kettering with Sylvia Berryman, a vocal tutor who had worked with Smith prior to her appearance on Britain's Got Talent. Smith said that she was ""really looking forward to singing locally again"", and it was again reported that Smith hoped to soon sign her own record deal.

In December 2008, Smith had signed a £2.3 million, multi-album deal with Universal Music Group. Universal claimed it intended to market Smith as a pop star. Neil Fisher, writing for The Times, described Smith as ""heir apparent"" to Jenkins; the pair had first met when Smith won a competition at the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod. By 2009, Jenkins was acting as a mentor to Smith.

In January 2009 plans were released for Smith to perform with Plácido Domingo, an idea originally suggested by him. In an interview with the Metro, Smith talked about her future plans, insisting that she did not wish to be dubbed as the next Charlotte Church. She later said that ""In the papers, it sounded like I was snobby when I said 'I don't want to be like Charlotte Church', but I didn't mean it like that."" She has also spoken of her desire to appear in films on top of her musical career. She said ""Films and movies are something I'd really like to do. I've always wanted to act, so doing a film would be amazing.""Smith's first album, Faryl, was recorded at Air Studios, London, in December 2008, during Smith's Christmas holiday; it was completed on 3 January 2009 and features a 60-piece orchestra. Smith said that her favourite song on the album was her version of the Welsh hymn ""Calon Lân"". Other songs include Smith's version of ""Amazing Grace"", a cover of John Denver's ""Annie's Song"", and a version of ""The Way Old Friends Do"", rewritten for Smith by Björn Ulvaeus. Smith described the song by saying that ""[i]t was about divorce ... They didn't think it was appropriate for me to sing about that, so Björn changed the lyrics so it's about friendship."" The album was produced by Jon Cohen, who had previously worked with artists including the Operababes and Vanessa Mae.

Promotion began in January, with performances at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel and appearances at the debut of 2009 London revival of Oliver!. A television advert and music video for ""River of Light"" were recorded to further publicise the release, and Smith appeared on the cover of April's Classic FM Magazine. More promotional appearances in the weeks leading up to the release of Faryl included Loose Women, The Paul O'Grady Show, BBC Radio 4, Radio Five Live and BBC Breakfast. She also appeared at the Children's Champion Awards and met Gordon Brown at 10 Downing Street. On the day of the release, there was an album signing in Smith's hometown of Kettering, at the HMV branch. Smith said ""I definitely want to be at home for the launch. I want to be surrounded by my friends and family because obviously, it's a big deal for me.""

Pete Paphides, writing for The Times, said that the songs were performed ""with power and restraint"" and that the ""arrangements by Jon Cohen suggest some kind of aesthetic endeavour beyond the basic thing for which they exist"". He compared it favourably to three other Mothering Sunday releases: Lionel Richie's Just Go, Ronan Keating's Songs for My Mother, and Barry Manilow's The Greatest Songs of the Eighties. He awarded Faryl 3 out of a possible 5, the highest rating of the four. On the day of the release the album was at the number one spot on the UK Albums Chart, based on presales alone. The album became the fastest-selling classical solo album in British history, selling 20,000 copies in the first four days. The previous record holder had been Hayley Westenra's Pure. The first week resulted in sales of 29,200 copies, which is higher than any other debut album of a classical singer. Faryl officially entered the charts at number six and rose to fourth place the next week. The success of the album left Smith the third Britain's Got Talent contestant to achieve a top ten album, after Potts (with One Chance) and Johnston (with One Voice).

In April 2009, Smith travelled to Los Angeles to begin her promotion of Faryl in the United States. She appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in early May as part of her promotional tour. Faryl was released in the US on 5 May. Smith said before the release that she did not expect it to sell as well as it did in the UK. She said that ""in the US it's a lot harder because I'm not as well-known"". Smith travelled back to the UK in early May, and, on 23 May, Faryl peaked at 31st place on Top Heatseekers Albums chart and at sixth place on the Classical Albums chart, remaining in the charts for one and 17 weeks respectively. Smith opened the 2009 Classical BRIT Awards, where, according to Elisa Roche of the Daily Express, she ""captivated the best names in classical music"". On 30 May, Smith became the youngest person to sing the United Kingdom national anthem, ""God Save The Queen"", at an FA Cup final when she performed during the opening ceremony at the 2009 final, held in the Wembley Stadium. In June, Smith performed a duet with José Carreras at the Hampton Court Palace Festival, and in July, she attended the O2 Silver Clef Awards, winning the Classical Award.

In February 2010, after the release of Smith's second album, Faryl was nominated for a Classical BRIT Award in the album category. The category is voted for by the public, and the shortlist comprises the ten best-selling classical albums of the previous year. Faryl lost to Only Men Aloud's Band of Brothers. Smith also lost in the young British classical performer category to Jack Liebeck, a violinist. Smith became the youngest artist ever to receive a double nomination. In November, Smith was awarded the best classical award at the 2009 Variety Club awards, the youngest recipient in the awards' history.In July 2009, it was announced that Smith was hoping to release her second album later in the year. In an interview, she expressed surprise and pleasure that the label wanted her to record another album so soon after the first. In September, further details about the album were released, including its name, Wonderland, and planned release date, 30 November. Smith claimed that Faryl ""was an introduction to me and an introduction for me to recording"", while Cohen, producer of both Faryl and Wonderland, said Smith had ""matured as an artist since the first album and I have no doubt that once again, people will be astonished and moved by her performances"". The album, which was recorded at Sarm Studios in Notting Hill, London, was completed in early October, and is loosely based on Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Wonderland was released on 30 November. To publicise the album, Smith appeared on numerous radio shows, as well as making television appearances including on Ready Steady Cook, Blue Peter, the BBC News Channel, The Alan Titchmarsh Show and Sky News Sunrise.

Wonderland was well received by critics; Paul Callan, reviewing the album for the Daily Express, described it as ""a joy"". He compared it to other Christmas albums, saying that ""[t]oo many are tired, much-repeated carol selections"". He described Smith's ""control, tone and warmth"" as ""very moving"". Andy Gill, reviewing Wonderland for The Independent, praised the arrangements of ""Adiemus"", ""Barcarolle"", ""Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence"" and ""Blow The Wind Southerly"". After Wonderland, Smith's contract with Universal ended, she described the break with the label as mainly her decision, as she needed to focus on her A Levels, which would allow her to get to university.

Smith performed at the 2009 Royal Variety Performance in front of Queen Elizabeth II, where she sang ""God Save the Queen"" with The Soldiers. She later said that the experience, including subsequently meeting the Queen, was the highlight of her year. Smith also performed elsewhere with The Soldiers, including at St Paul's Cathedral and Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital.In the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Smith and 22 other classical musicians from the UK recorded a cover version of ""The Prayer"", which was released for download on 14 March. The proceeds of the single went to the Disasters Emergency Committee. Smith said ""It's a real honour to be a part of something that is being done for the first time, and I hope that all music lovers get involved and help raise money for the campaign. I really hope that we can make a difference together to help the horrible situation that Haiti is in at the moment."" The group, dubbed ""Classical Band Aid"", recorded the track at Metropolis Studios and were backed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Each vocalist in the group performed their own solo lines, and the entire group came together for the finale.

In mid-2010, Smith performed at various festivals and events. Her father stated that ""because she is still so young, we don't want her doing complete shows on her own and we don't want her doing too much"". Appearances included the Mercedes-Benz World Summer Concert in Weybridge on 4 July, That Glorious Noise charity concert against muscular dystrophy in Cleethorpes on 17 July, and the Last Night of the Kenwood Proms on 21 August, as well as the wedding of Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford. Smith also opened the Serenata festival. Angela Young, reviewing the festival for the Bournemouth Daily Echo, said ""Faryl Smith was my personal highlight of the Thursday night line-up, her bizarrely powerful voice (considering her diminutive size and age) taking my breath away and it contrasted so well with her naivete as she said 'at least it's not raining' – just as the heavens opened.""

In October, Smith performed for the first time in Ireland, at the National Concert Hall, Dublin. She continued to perform publicly throughout 2011. In May, she performed at a Help for Heroes charity concert, which raised £2,000, and in both June and October, she performed at concerts to celebrate the 90th year of the Royal British Legion. She again appeared at the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod in July, where she sang with Russell Watson. Smith's father described the appearance as ""like a homecoming"", due to her previous appearance at the competition. In further charitable events later in the year, she raised £2,700 for a hospice in Cransley, and performed in aid of the Salvation Army in Portsmouth. During the Christmas period, Smith performed for the Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity in their annual Christmas carol concert, and at the North Wales Choral Festival at Llandudno. She also appeared as a guest on Rhydian Roberts's talent show on S4C in December. In 2012, she performed with the Mousehole Male Voice Choir in Penzance, and in 2013, she continued to perform locally in Kettering.

From 2012–13, Smith performed several times with the International Harp Ensemble, a Surrey-based group of harpists who produce a variety of different styles of harp music, including appearing with the group on a September episode of Songs of Praise. Smith began training with vocal coach Joy Mammen, who also teaches Lesley Garrett, as well as learning German and Italian, with the intention of moving from classical crossover towards opera.

Smith continued to perform publicly, appearing at assorted sporting, charitable, and other events. Sporting events at which Smith performed included the FA Community Shield match in 2015 at Wembley, the Checkatrade Trophy at Wembley in 2018, and a Six Nations match at Twickenham in 2019.","Year—Album—UK—US Heat—US Classical—Sales,2009—Faryl * Debut album * Released: 9 March 2009 * Labels: Universal Classics and Jazz—4—31—6—* UK: 150,000+,2009—Wonderland *Second studio album * Released: 30 November 2009 * Labels: Universal Classics and Jazz—56—–—–,",N/A,British soprano,23/6/1995,2008–present,Classical crossover,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faryl_Smith
Maisie Smith,"Smith lives in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, with her mother Julia, father Stephen and sister Scarlett. Smith attended Belfairs Academy in Leigh-on-Sea and the Sandra Singer Stage School. Smith attended South Essex College, where she studied musical theatre.","Smith attended the Singer Stage School in Leigh-on-Sea for 18 months, and in 2006, she was cast in the film The Other Boleyn Girl as a young Elizabeth I; the film was released in February 2008. She then went on to portray the role of Tiffany Dean in the BBC soap opera EastEnders. Smith made her first appearance on the soap on 1 April 2008, at age six, as the daughter of Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer). Her mother stated ""The role is an exaggeration of her own personality, she's a little madam. A lively character both on and off screen. The difference is, she's told to pronounce her t's at home! She is not star-struck at all and has her feet very firmly on the ground. She is an extremely confident child and a great actress."" Smith's father said, ""She gets recognised quite a lot when we go out as a family. It's funny when you see people nudge each other and you can hear them saying, ‘Is that the girl off EastEnders?’""

A few months after her casting, Smith said that she was loving being on EastEnders, telling the Echo (Essex) ""I love being on EastEnders. I really get on with Patsy who plays my mum. She looks after me so well. It's like I'm her real daughter some days. Everyone is really nice. Pam St Clement, who plays Pat Butcher, is also really lovely to me. I’m glad I get to be cheeky and say some funny lines. I would never want to be a goody goody. It's strange people point at me in the street now and ask if I’m the girl from EastEnders. All my friends think it's great I’m on television. I think I will want to be an actress forever now.""

Digital Spy's Kris Green said Smith is ""brilliant"" and ""one...to watch"", comparing her to Ellis Hollins, the award-winning child actor who plays Tom Cunningham in the Channel 4 teen soap opera Hollyoaks. She has also been praised by stage school teacher Sandra Singer, who said, ""Maisie has the most incredible memory and when it comes to script work she is fantastic. It is often very difficult for a six-year-old to act, but she handles it really well and adores it.""

In 2010, Smith was asked to appear on CITV's Bookaboo, and read the story Stinky by Ian Whybrow. Smith told CITV ""You have to be quiet in libraries which is really hard for me as I'm very loud. I would probably come last in a 'who can stay quiet the longest' competition!"" In 2011, Smith was interviewed by The Stage magazine where she talked about her role in EastEnders. Smith said, ""Sudden fame can be tricky when you are just out having fun and people keep wanting to take your photo, but the EastEnders people are very supportive and have said that we can politely say no in situations where we feel uncomfortable. I am very glad that my break came with EastEnders, as they are like a family who look after you. Working on the show has given me the chance to learn so much from the actors, especially those who are in my TV family. There are lots of things you can only learn from actually working on a set. The stage school I attend –also Singer Stage School – prepares you really well, but it is so different when you are actually there on set being filmed.""

In October 2016, it was announced Smith would be releasing her first single, ""Good Thing"". Smith shot a music video accompanying the song at the Belt Craft studios and the song and video was uploaded to Smith's YouTube channel in November 2016. Smith released her second single, ""Where My Heart Is"", in March 2017. Smith said a lot of her songs were about herself, so she ""wanted to write a song that inspired others"" and she hopes ""that got across"" and that it ""manages to inspire those who listen"". On 3 November 2016, Smith made a previously unannounced temporary return to EastEnders. Smith returned full-time in January 2018.

In September 2020, it was announced that she would be competing in the eighteenth series of Strictly Come Dancing. She was partnered with Gorka Márquez. In December 2020, they finished in second place alongside Hrvy & Janette Manrara and Jamie Laing & Karen Hauer, after losing out to Bill Bailey and Oti Mabuse.","Where My Heart Is—* Released: 15 September 2017 * Label: Independent * Format: Digital download,""Good Thing""—2016—Mark Potter,""Where My Heart Is""—2017—Mark Potter,","In May 2009, Smith won Best Dramatic Performance from a Young Actor or Actress at The British Soap Awards.

""Never Forget"", her collaboration with producer Darren Styles, was written and recorded in 2012.After being supported and later put forward by BBC Introducing, Molly was approached by Guy Freeman, the executive producer and head of delegation of Eurovision for the BBC and asked if she would like to compose an entry for that year's contest. After initially saying 'I'm so flattered, but it's not for me’ on the grounds that it was not 'suitable' to her creatively, eventually Smitten-Downes was convinced by the prospect of being able to perform a self-penned work on a global stage.

On 3 March 2014, the BBC announced that Molly would be representing the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 2014 with the song ""Children of the Universe"". Molly wrote ""Children of the Universe"" herself and has described her ambition to write music that ""breaks down political barriers"".

It was made available for digital download on iTunes from 15 April. The song was recorded in Stockholm, Sweden with a 28-piece orchestra and produced by Anders Hansson. The official video for the entry was released on YouTube on 23 April 2014. The following day, Molly appeared on BBC Radio 1's Innuendo Bingo. However at the Eurovision final on 10 May 2014, she was regarded as a front-runner and one of the favourites to win the show. Molly concluded the show performing last and the song was voted 17th (out of 26 entries) gaining 40 points.On 5 June it was revealed that Molly would perform at the Glastonbury Festival on 27 June 2014.

Sonia (singer),"Sonia married Mark Moses in 1998 and the couple have a daughter, who was born in 2010.","Sonia was signed to Chrysalis Records after badgering Pete Waterman to listen to her sing outside his recording studio in Liverpool. Waterman called her bluff and asked her to sing live on his weekly radio show. Sonia's debut single, ""You'll Never Stop Me Loving You"", composed and produced by the songwriting and music production trio Mike Stock, Matt Aitken and Pete Waterman (Stock Aitken Waterman) was released in June 1989. ""You'll Never Stop Me Loving You"" peaked at number 1 on the UK Singles Chart for two weeks the following month. At 18, Sonia became one of the youngest female British singers to achieve this feat. The single also topped the Irish chart and reached the Top 10 of the US dance chart.

Sonia's debut album, Everybody Knows, was released in April 1990. The album peaked at number 7 in the UK, and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry. All five singles released from the album became top 20 hits in the UK, making Sonia the first British solo female artist to achieve this. Sonia achieved a sixth top 20 hit in the UK in 1990 with ""You've Got a Friend"", recorded with the group Big Fun, and released as a charity single for Childline.

After tensions developed with Stock Aitken Waterman, Sonia left her record label and released her second, self-titled album in 1991, produced by Nigel Wright. The first single released from it, ""Only Fools (Never Fall in Love)"" became Sonia's third UK top 10 hit, although the album was less successful than her debut.

Sonia also contributed to two charity singles, Band Aid II's ""Do They Know It's Christmas?"" in 1989 (peaked at number 1 in the UK ) and Gulf Aid's ""As Time Stood Still"" in 1991.

In 1993, Sonia represented the United Kingdom in the 1993 Eurovision Song Contest, singing the Dean Collinson and Brian Teasdale composition ""Better the Devil You Know"". She was placed second in the contest. Her third album, also titled Better the Devil You Know was released that year and reached number 32 in the UK.

In 1994, Sonia replaced singer Debbie Gibson as Sandy in the West End musical Grease. A cover of ""Hopelessly Devoted To You"" was released as a tie-in single, but it only peaked at number 61 in the UK.

In 1995, Sonia released a cover of ""Wake Up Everybody"", which did not enter the UK Top 100. It was to be the lead single of her fourth album, the soul covers album Love Train - The Philly Album, but Sonia was unhappy with it and it only received a promotional release.

Sonia performed a vocal part in Italian eurobeat singer Nuage's I'm Never Gonna Let You Down And Forget You, released in Japan in 2004, produced by Dave Rodgers.

Late 2007 saw the release of Sonia's Greatest Hits album. However, this compilation only featured recordings from Sonia's two albums released on BMG.

In 2007, prior to Sonia's ""Greatest Hits"" release, she recorded two Motown-influenced songs, ""Dancing in the Driver's Seat"" and ""Your Heart Or Mine"", both of which were written by Barry Upton and U.S. songwriter Gordon Pogoda. However, her record label decided to include no new songs on ""Greatest Hits"" so both tracks remained unreleased until 2018.

In 2008, Sonia recorded a cover of The Beatles' classic ""She Loves You"" for the Liverpool – The Number Ones Album.

On 1 June 2009, Sonia released her first single for 14 years, ""Fool for Love"".

In October 2010, the ""Everybody Knows"" album was remastered and re-issued in expanded form, containing two additional tracks, extended versions of her first four singles, and a demo version of ""You'll Never Stop Me Loving You."" Also in 2010, Sonia's cover version of ""You've Got a Friend"", a duet with Big Fun, was released on a reissue of the group's debut album.

On 21 December 2012, Sonia performed at the Stock Aitken Waterman ""Hit Factory Live"" reunion concert at London's The O2, along with many other former SAW acts, including Kylie Minogue.

In summer 2018, in conjunction with her appearance in the Channel 5 program Celebrity 5 Go Caravanning, Sonia's recording of ""Dancing in the Driver's Seat"", written by Barry Upton and Gordon Pogoda, was released. Another song recorded with Barry Upton and Gordon Pogoda in 2007, ""Your Heart Or Mine"", was released in 2018 as its follow-up.

Sonia signed a new record deal with Energise Records in 2019, and a new single, ""A Night That's Never Ending"", was released November 2019.","Album—Peak chart positions,Album—UK—AUS,Everybody Knows *Released: 23 April 1990 *Format: LP, cassette, CD, DLD *Label: Chrysalis—7—144,Sonia *Released: 7 October 1991 *Format: LP, cassette, CD, DLD *Label: IQ Records—33,Better the Devil You Know *Released: 17 May 1993 *Format: LP, cassette, CD, DLD *Label: Arista—32,Love Train – The Philly Album *Released: 1998 *Format: Promotional release only *Label: BMG,""—"" denotes releases that did not chart.,",N/A,English pop singer,13/1/1971,1989–present,Pop,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_(singer)
Charlene Soraia,"Born and raised in Sydenham, London Borough of Lewisham in London, Charlene Soraia grew up with her parents. She first picked up her father's guitar at the age of 5, and played her first show at 8. She was inspired by artists such as David Bowie, The Beatles, Pink Floyd and King Crimson, and was very interested in the prog-rock genre.

While still at school, Soraia used to appear at open mic night at The Studio, Beckenham, Bromley in London around 2004, where her style and songwriting were still developing. She used the time before her performances to do her homework.

She attended into the BRIT School alongside future chart artists Adele and Kate Nash. While being there, she formed a rock band called Retrospect, with whom she released an EP entitled Long Hair, Short Memories. She also joined a psychedelic blues band, Electriq Mistress. At the same time she released a solo EP, ""Lemonade"", which was mainly created to get her bookings. She began performing as a solo artist in 2008, releasing further EPs Daffodils and Other Idylls (March 2008); Postcards from iO later in the year and third in the series, One of the Sun. The former reached the top of the UK Folk Chart on iTunes. An iTunes Live Sessions EP was also released after she performed at the festival in early 2008.","Soraia became noticed by a mainstream audience in 2011 when her cover of ""Wherever You Will Go"" by The Calling was featured in a Twinings commercial. The song was subsequently released as a digital download on iTunes and reached number 2 on the UK Download Chart and number 3 in the UK Singles Chart. The original version of the song, which itself peaked at number 3 in the UK in June 2002 from the album ""Camino Palmero"", also re-entered the top 40 as a result, this time reaching number 16. Her debut album Moonchild, featuring the song as a bonus track, was released on 21 November 2011. On 10 January 2013, Soraia released the video for her song ""Ghost"".

Her parents, being from Pontrilas in Herefordshire, led her to receiving her first airplay on BBC Hereford & Worcester including a BBC Introducing session at the Courtyard in Hereford. She was discovered by Tom Robinson when he heard her music on MySpace, and he invited her to play on his BBC Radio 2 and BBC 6 Music radio shows in April 2009. Subsequently, her singles ""Red"" and ""Never Quite An Angel"" were playlisted on Radio 2 for 5 and 6 weeks respectively, and ""Just Like Me"" was single of the week on the Radcliffe and Maconie Show.

Stainton toured with Joan Armatrading in April 2010.

Lisa Stansfield,"In 1987, Stansfield married Italian designer Augusto Grassi, whom she had met during a holiday in Tunisia. A ceremony was held in the Sacred Heart Church in Rochdale. The couple moved to Zagarolo, Italy, but their marriage lasted only four months. Following the end of the marriage, Stansfield returned to Britain. After many years of friendship and engagement, she and Ian Devaney married on 25 July 1998. The minimalist ceremony was held in Washington Square Park in New York City, and the only guests were her parents and his mother.

In 2008, Stansfield sold her six-bedroom Victorian house ""Mount Henry"" on Torca Road in Dalkey, Ireland, for €6 million to Yorkshire business tycoon Ed Clark (having originally asked for €8 million in May 2007).","In 1984, Stansfield and former schoolmates Ian Devaney and Andy Morris, after having worked together on a school musical production, began to collaborate musically and, in 1986, formed the band Blue Zone. They wrote some songs, produced a demo, and took it around to record labels. The small indie label Rockin' Horse Records signed them in 1985, and one year later the label was bought up by Arista Records. After releasing their first two singles in 1986, ""Love Will Wait"" and ""Finest Thing"", Arista issued ""On Fire"" in October 1987. Just as the single was climbing the charts (number ninety-nine in the United Kingdom), it was withdrawn by the record company in the wake of the King's Cross fire. The band's next single, ""Thinking About His Baby,"" was released in January 1988 and reached number seventy-nine in the UK. Its B-side, ""Big Thing,"" became popular on the radio and in the clubs.

In July 1988, ""Jackie"" was issued as a single outside the UK, reaching number thirty-seven on the Hot Dance Club Songs and number fifty-four on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. The release date for Blue Zone's album Big Thing, which was recorded in 1987, was pushed back many times by the record label. Finally, it was released outside the UK in November 1988 without any further promotion. The album included songs written by Blue Zone, except for ""Jackie,"" which was written by Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly. The album was produced by Paul Staveley O'Duffy, except for the track ""Perfect Crime,"" which was produced by Blue Zone. Ric Wake also co-produced ""Jackie"" and ""Perfect Crime.""In early 1989, Stansfield co-wrote and recorded ""People Hold On"" for Coldcut's album What's That Noise? The single was released in March 1989, and reached number six on the Hot Dance Club Songs in the United States and number eleven in the United Kingdom. On the strength of this hit, Arista Records signed Stansfield to a solo deal. Her debut album Affection was released on 20 November 1989. Stansfield co-wrote all songs with Ian Devaney and Andy Morris. Devaney and Morris also produced the album, except for ""This Is the Right Time,"" which was produced by Coldcut.

It reached the top ten on charts around the world, including number one in Austria and Italy, number two in the UK, Germany, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, number three in Belgium, number five in New Zealand, number six in the Netherlands and Norway, and number seven in Australia and Canada. In the U.S., it peaked at number five on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, and number nine on the Billboard 200.

In 1992, Stansfield toured Europe, Asia and the United States, and released the Live at Wembley home video.

The single was issued in May 1993, and reached number eight in the UK and Ireland. It was later included on Stansfield's third studio album, So Natural, released on 8 November 1993.

Joss Stone,"Joscelyn Eve Stoker was born on 11 April 1987 at Buckland Hospital in Dover, Kent, and spent her teenage years in Ashill, a small village near Cullompton in Devon. She is the third of four children born to Wendy (née Skillin) and Richard Stoker. Her father owns a fruit and nut import&ndash;export business; her mother worked as Stone's manager until October 2004. Stone made her first public appearance at the Uffculme Comprehensive School—which she attended —in Uffculme, Devon, with a cover version of Jackie Wilson's 1957 song ""Reet Petite"". Stone has dyslexia and left school at age sixteen with only three GCSE qualifications. ""It wasn't that I was stupid. I'm just a little bit dyslexic and I wasn't very academic. I'm more artistic"", she says.

Stone grew up listening to a wide variety of music including 1960s and 1970s American R&B and soul music performed by such artists as Dusty Springfield and Aretha Franklin. As a result, she developed a soulful style of singing like her idols. ""My first CD that I owned was Aretha Franklin: Greatest Hits. And I saw the advert on TV and it was just like little clips of her songs. I had no idea who she was—I was only like 10 so. I said, 'Oh yeah, that looks really good', so I wrote it down and I said to my mum, 'Can I have that for Christmas?' So she told my friend Dennis, who always gets me good music anyway, and he got that for me. So that was one of my first albums that I loved."" She would later tell MTV News: ""I kind of clicked into soul music more than anything else because of the vocals. You've got to have good vocals to sing soul music and I always liked it ever since I was little.""","In 2001, at the age of thirteen, Stone auditioned for the BBC Television talent show, Star for a Night in London, singing Franklin's 1968 Goffin-King hit ""(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman"" and Whitney Houston's 1999 single, ""It's Not Right but It's Okay"". After passing her audition, she sang Donna Summer's ""On the Radio"" for the broadcast, and eventually won the contest. She also appeared on and won Steps to the Stars (a TV programme hosted by H & Claire of the group Steps). Stone then performed on a charity show, where she drew the attention of the Boilerhouse Boys, composed of London-based producers Andy Dean and Ben Wolfe, who contacted S-Curve Records founder and CEO, Steve Greenberg in December 2001 telling him that ""they had just heard the greatest singer they'd ever heard from their country."" In early 2002, Greenberg flew Stone to New York for an audition, in which she sang to backing tracks of classic soul songs: Otis Redding's 1968 ""(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay"", Gladys Knight & the Pips' 1973 ""Midnight Train to Georgia"", and Franklin's ""(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman""; Greenberg instantly signed her to his label.

After being signed by S-Curve Records, her US market album was released by the label S-Curve Records and in the international market her album was released by the label EMI Music. Stone flew to Miami and Philadelphia to start work on her debut album, The Soul Sessions, released on 16 September 2003. She collaborated with people with solid credentials in the Miami soul scene such as Betty Wright, Benny Latimore, Timmy Thomas and Little Beaver as well as contemporary acts Angie Stone and the Roots. The album, produced by Steve Greenberg, Mike Mangini and Betty Wright, consists of little-known soul tracks by Franklin, Laura Lee, Bettye Swann and others. Released in late 2003, it reached the top five on the UK Albums Chart as well as the top forty of the US Billboard 200 chart. The lead single, ""Fell in Love with a Boy"", a reworking of the White Stripes' 2001 ""Fell in Love with a Girl"", reached the top 20 of the UK Singles Chart, as did the second single, a cover version of Sugar Billy's 1974 song ""Super Duper Love (Are You Diggin' on Me)"". The album eventually went triple platinum by the British Phonographic Industry in mid-April 2005 and gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in late March 2004.After achieving critical acclaim with The Soul Sessions, Stone worked on new material, and recorded her second album, Mind Body & Soul, which was released on 28 September 2004, produced by the same team as her first album. She called the album her real debut. It debuted at No. one in the UK, breaking the record for the youngest female ever to top the UK Albums Chart, and just missed the top ten of the US Billboard 200 after peaking at No. 11. The lead single, ""You Had Me"", became her biggest hit to date when it rose to No. 9 in the UK. Follow-up singles ""Right to Be Wrong"" and ""Spoiled"" both made the top 40, and ""Don't Cha Wanna Ride"", the top 20. ""Spoiled"" landed just outside the top 50 of US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, peaking at No. 54. In early September 2005, Mind, Body & Soul was certified triple platinum by the BPI and platinum by the RIAA.

In April 2004, Stone performed alongside Cam Noble during the VH1's benefit concert Divas Live 2004 alongside Ashanti, Cyndi Lauper, Gladys Knight, Jessica Simpson and Patti LaBelle, in support of the Save the Music Foundation. Stone joined Band Aid 20 on 14 November 2004 in benefit of Sudan's troubled Darfur region. The group, which included Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin and U2 lead singer Bono, re-recorded the 1984 song ""Do They Know It's Christmas?"", written by Band Aid organisers Bob Geldof and Midge Ure. Stone, who was born two years after the release of the original single, was not initially aware of who Bob Geldof was. The media gleefully reported that she repeatedly referred to him as Bob Gandalf. Despite some criticism, the single became the UK's biggest-selling single of 2004 as well as the 2004 Christmas number-one single.

At the 2005 BRIT Awards, Stone won for British Female Solo Artist and British Urban Act—entering the Guinness World Records as the youngest BRIT Award solo winner at age seventeen, and was nominated for British Breakthrough Act. She also received a nomination for Best UK Act of the Year at the 2005 MOBO Awards, as well as three nominations for the 2005 Grammy Awards—Best New Artist, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for ""You Had Me"", and Best Pop Vocal Album for Mind Body & Soul, where she sang with rock performer Melissa Etheridge, in tribute to blues-rock singer Janis Joplin. Their performance of ""Cry Baby/Piece of My Heart"" was released as a single, and through the aid of strong digital download sales, became Stone's first single to enter the US Billboard Hot 100, when it debuted and peaked at No. 32 the week of 2 April 2005.

In March 2005, Stone was named the spokesperson for the Gap clothing company, replacing the actress Sarah Jessica Parker. She appeared in a television advertisement for that store chain singing a cover of Ray Charles's 1958 song ""Night Time Is the Right Time"" (retitled ""The Right Time""). Stone also appeared in one of Gap's Fall 2005 ""Favorites"" commercials, singing the Beach Boys' 1966 song ""God Only Knows"". By that time, rumours circulated about her being dropped from the campaign because she was living with then-25-year-old songwriter and producer Beau Dozier (son of Motown producer and composer Lamont Dozier) in Los Angeles while she was only 17. However, Gap later denied the rumours, stating that they were very happy with Stone and telling BBC Radio 1 that the claims were ""absolute tosh"" and ""a complete fabrication"". On 11 April 2005, Stone performed ""Spoiled"", Rufus' 1974 song ""Tell Me Something Good"" with John Legend, Otis Redding's 1966 song ""Try a Little Tenderness"" with Donna Summer, and 1977's ""Hot Legs"" with Rod Stewart at ""Save the Music: A Concert to Benefit the VH1 Save the Music Foundation"", in benefit of VH1's Save the Music Foundation. Three months later, on 2 July 2005, Stone performed ""Super Duper Love"", ""I Had a Dream"", and ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" at the Live 8 concert at Hyde Park, London. Stone was an opening act for the Rolling Stones during their 2005 A Bigger Bang tour.

Stone performed a medley of ""It's a Man's World"" and ""Papa's Got a Brand New Bag"" with James Brown on BBC One's chat show Friday Night with Jonathan Ross on 1 July 2005. Stone collaborated with jazz pianist Herbie Hancock and blues singer-guitarist Jonny Lang on a cover of U2's 1988 song ""When Love Comes to Town"" for Hancock's 2005 album Possibilities. That same year, Stone was featured along with Sean Paul on Santana's ""Cry Baby Cry"", and worked on a remake of Patti LaBelle's 1985 song ""Stir It Up"" for the soundtrack to the Disney animated film Chicken Little. She also collaborated with Lemar in 2006 on his third studio album, The Truth About Love, on the track ""Anniversary"".

On 5 February 2006, Stone joined Stevie Wonder, India.Arie, and John Legend during the Super Bowl XL pre-game ceremonies to perform a medley of Wonder's hits. Three days later, on 8 February, on the night of the 2006 Grammy Awards, she helped perform a medley of Sly & the Family Stone's hits alongside Legend, Ciara, Maroon 5, will.i.am, Robert Randolph, Steven Tyler and Joe Perry. Stone made her film debut in the fantasy adventure film Eragon (based on the 2003 novel of the same name by Christopher Paolini), directed by Stefen Fangmeier and released on 15 December 2006, playing the fortune teller Angela. At the 2007 Grammy Awards, Stone shared the award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for her collaboration with John Legend and Van Hunt on their 2005 cover of Sly & the Family Stone's 1971 chart-topper ""Family Affair"".Stone caused controversy at the 2007 BRIT Awards ceremony on 14 February 2007 while presenting the award for British Male Solo Artist (won by James Morrison). Speaking in an American accent, she circled the podium and gave a speech about Robbie Williams, who had been the target of earlier jokes made by host Russell Brand. Williams had been reported as going into rehabilitation that same week. As her speech continued, she made remarks about Brand, implying that he was heading for rehabilitation himself (while singing a passage of Amy Winehouse's hit ""Rehab""). In response to the British media's reaction, Stone responded, ""At the end of the day, I don't give a fuck if people have a problem with my accent. That's all I can say about it. The words I say do not change. If the way that it sounds is skew-wiff and you don't like it, don't listen. I'm not being a cruel person by sounding a different way. And I can't help it. I've been [in America working] since I was, like, 14."" Stone later claimed that her record label cancelled all her upcoming press appearances to publicise her upcoming third album as a result of the backlash.

Stone began work on her third studio album, Introducing Joss Stone, at Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas, in May 2006. Released on 12 March 2007, the album was coordinated by A&R Chris Anokute, produced by Raphael Saadiq, and included collaborations with Lauryn Hill, Common, and Joi. Virgin Records describes the album as ""an electrifying mix of warm vintage soul, 1970s-style R&B, Motown girl-group harmonies, and hip-hop grooves"". Stone herself describes it as ""truly me. That's why I'm calling it Introducing Joss Stone. These are my words, and this is who I am as an artist."" She also revealed on The Tavis Smiley Show that her break-up with Beau Dozier was a source of inspiration while writing Introducing Joss Stone. The album debuted and peaked at No. 12 on the UK Albums Chart, not managing to match the success of Stone's two previous albums. It nevertheless debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 selling 118,000 copies in its first week, becoming the highest debut for a British solo female artist on the US chart, surpassing the record previously held by Amy Winehouse with Back to Black (which in turn would later be outdone by Leona Lewis, whose album Spirit debuted at No. 1 the week of 26 April 2008).

""Tell Me 'Bout It"", the album's lead single, debuted and peaked at No. 28 on the UK Singles Chart. The second single, ""Tell Me What We're Gonna Do Now"", a collaboration with rapper Common, failed to chart inside the UK top seventy-five. Stone and Common turned the single's music video into a Product Red, reverting 100% of the gains from copies of the video purchased from iTunes to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Stone is the first Product Red artist to do so. Stone also sampled Franklin's ""Respect"", taking the texture and sound of the song, but keeping her own composition. ""Baby Baby Baby"" was released digitally in December 2007 and physically in January 2008 as the third single. In support of the album, Stone embarked on a North American tour which began on 27 April at Foxwoods Resort Casino in Ledyard, Connecticut and ended on 13 June at the Filene Center in Vienna, Virginia, visiting sixteen cities in total including Philadelphia, San Francisco, Vancouver, Chicago, Toronto, New York and Boston. Two months later, she went on a North American late-summer tour which kicked off on 27 August at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles and ended on 29 September at the Crossroads in Kansas City, Missouri, covering twelve cities—this time including Mexico City.Stone was photographed by Canadian singer-guitarist and photographer Bryan Adams for Phonak's Hear the World initiative, whose main goal is to raise global awareness for the topic of hearing and hearing loss. On 7 July 2007, Stone performed at the South African leg of the Live Earth concerts at the Coca-Cola Dome in Johannesburg, to promote awareness of global warming. She sang the Introducing Joss Stone tracks ""Girl They Won't Believe It"", ""Headturner"", ""Tell Me What We're Gonna Do Now"", ""Music"", and ""Tell Me 'bout It"", as well as Mind, Body & Soul's ""Right to Be Wrong"" and ""Gimme Shelter"", the latter with Angélique Kidjo. Stone covered Nat King Cole's 1965 song ""L-O-V-E"" for an advertising campaign for Chanel's Coco Mademoiselle fragrance.

On 29 November 2007, Stone joined Jeff Beck on a duet of the Impressions's 1965 song ""People Get Ready"" as part of his series of concerts at London's Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club, documented on the DVD Performing This Week: Live at Ronnie Scott's. To raise the awareness of AIDS, Annie Lennox joined forces with twenty-three female acts (including Stone) and recorded the song ""Sing"", which was released on World AIDS Day on 1 December 2007, when Lennox performed at one of Nelson Mandela's 46664 concerts at Johannesburg's Ellis Park Stadium. In mid-December 2007, Stone was named the new Flake girl to star in a series of television adverts for the Cadbury Schweppes product in the spring of 2008. According to the company, she is the first non-model to take the role.

In March 2008, Stone landed the role of lesbian bingo caller Stephanie in the British romantic comedy film Snappers, for which she also wrote music. However, the film was never released. Stone made her television debut portraying Henry VIII's fourth wife Anne of Cleves in the third season of the Showtime series The Tudors. She reprised the role in the show's final season in 2010, appearing in two episodes.

Stone launched a legal battle in a bid to leave her record label, EMI, and free her of her current three-album deal with the record label in April 2008. Stone performed at the 19th Annual GLAAD Media Awards at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles on 26 April 2008. She also performed ""Right to Be Wrong"" at the LA PRIDE 2008—produced by Christopher Street West, a non-profit organisation—in West Hollywood, California, on 7 June 2008. On 26 October 2008, Stone sang the British national anthem, God Save the Queen, before the NFL match between the San Diego Chargers and the New Orleans Saints, held at Wembley Stadium, London.

On 7 December 2008, Stone performed the Who's 1965 song ""My Generation"" on CBS's Kennedy Center Honors TV special at the Kennedy Center, Washington, D.C., honouring Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey. In 2010, Stone also appeared on Ringo Starr's album, Y Not on the song ""Who's Your Daddy"" in which she sang and co-wrote with the ex-Beatle; appeared on Jeff Beck's album, Emotion and Commotion on the songs ""There's No Other Me"" and ""I Put a Spell on You"", being the last one nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at 53rd Grammy Awards. In late 2010, Stone's voice and likeness were used for the ""Bond girl"" character of Nicole Hunter, a jewellery designer and MI6 agent, in the video game James Bond 007: Blood Stone. In addition to portraying the character, she also performed the game's theme song, ""I'll Take It All"", which was co-written and performed with Dave Stewart.

In 2010, Stone provided vocals on two songs for the charity-focused audio drama production, 'A Voyage For Soldier Miles'. The songs are Lover Earth written by Dave Stewart and Mark Warford and Never Gonna Be The Same written and performed by Mark Warford and Niels Lan Doky.

Stone's fourth studio album was written and recorded in about a week in Devon in early 2008. She said: ""It's very, very raw. It's a bunch of musicians, writers and myself, and we're just jamming, basically."" In promotion of the album, entitled Colour Me Free!, Stone played concerts throughout the United Kingdom in February and March. Originally scheduled for release in April 2009, Colour Me Free! was finally released on 20 October 2009. Stone said that her record company also fought her about the original cover of her new album, calling it ""offensive"". It was changed to simple text and no picture of the singer on the American edition, the original cover was used on the other editions worldwide. In late August 2010, it was reported that Stone had left EMI and formed her own independent record label, Stone'd Records. EMI announced in late December that they would be releasing a greatest hits album, The Best of Joss Stone 2003–2009. The compilation was released on 30 September 2011.

In 2010, Stone collaborated with Puerto Rican recording artist Ricky Martin for ""The Best Thing About Me Is You"", and peaked at No. 74 on the U.S Billboard Hot 100 and which topped the Hot Latin Songs and Latin Pop Songs chart, this was Stone's first number-one on all two charts, which also made her the first Briton of non-Hispanic origin to reach No. 1 on the Hot Latin Tracks and Latin Pop Songs chart.On 14 June 2011, police arrested two men in Cullompton, Devon, near Stone's home, for plotting to rob and murder her. After a trial at Exeter Crown Court for conspiracy to rob, murder and commit grievous bodily harm against her, they were found guilty and convicted on 3 April 2013.

Stone partnered with Surfdog Records to release LP1 on 26 July 2011, through her own label Stone'd Records. The album was recorded in Nashville, Tennessee in six days, where Stone co-wrote and co-produced the album with Eurythmics co-founder, David Stewart The lead single, ""Somehow"", was released on 24 June 2011. Stone also joined the supergroup SuperHeavy which was formed by Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones, together with Dave Stewart (credited by Mick with the original idea of SuperHeavy), Damian Marley (the youngest son of Bob Marley) and the Indian musician and producer A.R. Rahman. The album was recorded at Jim Henson Studios in Los Angeles and was released on 20 September 2011 by A&M Records. The debut single, ""Miracle Worker"", was released on 19 July 2011.

Released in July 2012, The Soul Sessions Vol. 2 saw Stone return to her original label, S-Curve Records, who released the album jointly with the artist's Stone'd Records, and features production from Steve Greenberg (producer of the first ""Soul Sessions""). The album finds Stone largely covering lesser-known soul songs from the 1970s and 1980s by acts including the Chi-Lites, the Honey Cone, the Dells, Sylvia, Labi Siffre and Linda Lewis. The album reached the top 10 on the US Billboard 200 and the UK album chart. In the UK it was her first top 10 album since 2004's Mind Body & Soul. In 2013 she performed live shows including Indonesia and the Philippines. She also made an appearance on UK series Top Gear.

Stone announced to newspaper La Vanguardia back in July 2012 that she would work on a reggae album. She stated that it would be recorded and produced by her and Damian Marley, who previously worked in SuperHeavy. In March 2014, she elaborated that the new album would be a little bit different and ""more eclectic"" with a ""little bit more hip-hop and reggae"". On 31 July 2015 her album Water for Your Soul was released, and was the number-one reggae album the week it came out. In April 2014 she began The Total World Tour with the intention of performing in as many countries as possible. In November 2017 Stone, along with Nitin Sawhney, Jonathan Shorten, Jonathan Joseph and Cameroonian multi-instrumentalist Étienne M'Bappé released the Project Mama Earth, an 11-track EP comprising full-length songs and interludes, inspired by Mother Nature concept and African rhythms. In the same month, she was co-headliner in Night of the Proms in Nederland and Belgium. In October 2018, Stone was cast as a guest-star in season 5 of musical drama television series Empire.At the beginning of 2019 Stone sang with James Morrison on the song ""My Love Goes On"", making it four years since both singers last released studio albums.

In March 2019 Stone embarked on her first full world tour alongside producer Cam Noble.

Roxanne Tataei,"Born and raised in Norbury, London, England Roxanne Tataei's heritage is half-Jamaican (mother) and half-Iranian (father). She cites living with her grandparents and being a regular churchgoer as her introduction to singing.

By age 10, Tataei was a part of the National Youth Music Theatre and travelled across Britain appearing in various productions with them. By her 14th birthday she had her first guitar and was experimenting with several musical genres. She rehearsed her music at Scream Studios in Croydon.

Tataei's musical influences include Lauryn Hill, Joni Mitchell, Sade, Mary J. Blige and Alanis Morissette.","After forming her first band in 2007, Tataei attracted interest from a variety of labels before signing with Rough Trade in November 2008. Since signing, she has appeared on tours with the likes of Mark Ronson and Daniel Merriweather and on such television shows as Later... with Jools Holland (Series 35).

Tataei's debut single, ""No Going Back"", was released on seven-inch vinyl on 15 December 2009. She told Steve Lamacq on his Radio 2 show that the song is about ""leaving a relationship and not wanting to go back to that situation.""

Tataei's next single, ""My Baby Left Me"", was released on 15 March 2010 and made the BBC Radio 2 A-List and has received other critical success. She entered the Dutch Top 40 on 17 April 2010 at Number 35, moving to a new peak of 27 a week later.

Tataei released her debut album, Memoirs, on 7 June 2010, which features the previously released singles and 10 other tracks. The album was partially recorded in New Jersey in April 2009 with ""Commissioner"" Gordon Williams, but mainly in London with Jay-Z and Lupe Fiasco producer Al Shux.

Her third single, ""I Don't Believe"", was released at the same time as her album. The music video was posted by Tataei on her official Twitter on 4 May 2010. It was also used in an advertising campaign by Rimmel.

Her fourth single, ""Rocksteady"", was also included as soundtrack EA Sports game, 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa.

Tataei's single 'My Baby Left Me' has been used in the 2013 movie Girl Most Likely as background music for the 'sex-scene' between Kristen Wiig and Darren Criss.","Year—Album details—UK—NL—FRA—ITA,2010—Memoirs *Released: 7 June 2010 *Formats: CD, download—97—37—76—11,Year—Single—UK—NL—GER—ITA—Album,2009—""No Going Back""—Memoirs,2010—""My Baby Left Me""—91—12—35—11—Memoirs,2010—""I Don't Believe""—Memoirs,2010—""Rocksteady""—Memoirs,Year—Album details—UK—NL—FRA—ITA,2018—Full Moon in Aries *Released: 24 September 2018 *Formats: CD, download,Year—Album details—UK—NL—FRA—ITA,2015—Grey Area *Released: 27 November 2015 *Formats: Download,Year—Single—UK—NL—GER—ITA—Album,2015—""My Weakness""—Grey Area,2018—""Crimson Eyes""—Full Moon in Aries,",N/A,an English singer-songwriter from South London,1988,2007–present,Soul · R&B · reggae,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxanne_Tataei
Jane Taylor (musician),"Taylor was born in Lincolnshire in 1972, in an RAF hospital at Nocton Hall. As well as being in the RAF, her father was an artist, songwriter and guitarist. His musical talent and love of Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and Simon and Garfunkel influenced the young Jane, as did her mother's love of classical music.

She picked up her father's guitar at the age of five and composed her first song. Brought up in a village near Newark, Nottinghamshire, she attended Brownies and Sunday School at the local Church Hall. She continued to play the guitar and piano and composed throughout her childhood, winning school competitions and gaining a reputation for playing her music to the school. At the age of 19, Jane went to Keele University, Staffordshire, where her music took on a political flavour. In particular, a song entitled ""Tiananmen Square"" became a much loved anthem for many of the students visiting the folk club there in the 1990s.Following university, she landed a job in the music industry working for one of the few independents at the time, The Grapevine Label Ltd. Grapevine had signed Emmylou Harris, Christy Moore, and Joan Baez. There she learned how to make and manufacture a record, and most importantly how to promote and sell a record..In 2003, Taylor decided to give up her normal job and become a full-time singer-songwriter. A month later, she recorded her first single with Massive Attack guitarist Angelo Bruschini. The track was called ""Blowing This Candle Out"" and went on to win Best Song in the 'International Songwriter of the Year' competition, and landed Taylor her first major gig at Ronnie Scotts. She also went on to tour in Germany and Italy, gathering more fans along the way.

Sony TV requested permission to play the track ""Getting To Me"" (which was just a demo at the time) on the TV series Dawson's Creek. Taylor set up her own record label, Bicycle Records.Together with Bill Lovelady, Taylor and her band created her first album Montpelier. When Johnnie Walker played the song ""Fall on Me"" on his BBC Radio 2 show in 2006, he was inundated with emails wanting to know who this new singer-songwriter was, where they could find out about her, and most importantly would he ""Please play more"". Walker invited Taylor to play a live session on his show. Taylor has since appeared on the Radio 4 show Loose Ends, secured an international distribution deal with Pinnacle, had a track from the album included on The Word magazine, and landed support slots opening for Jools Holland, Bill Wyman, Paolo Nutini, Seth Lakeman, Midge Ure, Andy Fairweather-Low and Paul Buchanan of The Blue Nile.Compass was released in 2008, with a number of special album preview shows in Scotland. The first official launch was in Bristol's converted church, Circomedia. Shortly afterwards Taylor discovered she was pregnant, so plans for a re-release of the album were made for 2010. Meanwhile, songs from the album have been played on the Bob Harris show on BBC Radio 2.

Get Rhythm said: ""Jane Taylor is no ordinary singer songwriter. She has this intangible magic in her voice. The kind that draws you in and holds you right there until the moment you notice that you've forgotten to breathe and then you hear her words (which bizarrely seem to have been written for you), and stand there transfixed like it's a bit of fate that brought you here and I will defy anyone not to leave without a CD or at least humming one of her songs.""

In January 2011, Compass won Best Album in the Singer-Songwriter Category at the 10th Annual Independent Music Awards.","Jane Taylor's debut album hit BBC national radio when Johnnie Walker decided to play the opening track from an album entitled Montpelier that he found on his desk, because he liked the cover (a charcoal sketch of her street which Jane had doodled herself). The response from the listeners was enormous, highly unusual for an 'unknown' and Johnnie Walker played the track over 15 times, despite it not actually being on the playlist and invited Taylor into the studio to perform a live session on the show.

Her first album Montpelier had been made on a shoe-string, in a barn, with all manufacturing costs financed by pre selling the album to her dedicated fan base (which she had home grown from the city of Bristol). Taylor, producer Bill Lovelady and her band recorded the album in nine days in a freezing October. Once it was made she just posted it to BBC Radio 2 and crossed her fingers.

Because of the response to the airplay she was invited into the BBC to perform a live session on the show. From there she went on to support Jools Holland, Bill Wyman, Seth Lakeman, Paul Buchanan, Andy Fairweather Low and Paulo Nutini. She secured a distribution deal, had ""Fall on Me"" played on MTV, and toured the UK and Germany, spreading the word and connecting her music to even more people.

Two years later, Taylor released her second album, Compass which was financially backed by two fans of her music whom Taylor now refers to as 'The Angels'. Taylor had never met her benefactors before, but they are now friends indeed. She made the album with Mercury nominated producer Colin Elliot (famous for his work on the Richard Hawley albums) in Sheffield's Yellow Arch Studios.

The album featured the Grimethorpe Colliery Brass Band (who performed in the film Brassed Off), a gospel choir made up of some of the finest songwriters and musicians in Bristol and Bath, a rhythm track featuring everything from a rustling bin to the cellists impression of the sound of a dolphin, and classical string arrangements from her resident band Robin Davies, Bethany Porter and Feargus Heatherington.

Tracks from Compass received BBC Radio 2 airplay. The album recently won an award for Best Album in the Folk / Singer-Songwriter category in the 2010 Independent Music Awards.

After taking some time out to give birth to her son, she booked a concert at St George's Hall, Bristol, which was sold out. Taylor invited musicians to join her on stage including Lizz Lipscombe on violin, Robert Bray on percussion and uke, Robin Davies on double bass and Kate Robey on cello. Other guests included marimba player Alphonse Daudet Touna, singer-songwriter Roger Tarry, The JT Brass Players (Andy Davies, Matt Davies and Chris Sanders) and the Barefoot Collective & Original Sing choirs. The concert was a success and was voted one of the top three gigs in the South West for 2010 by Bristol's Venue Magazine. A recording of the concert was released as Live Album in November 2011. In December 2011, Taylor released her new single ""Oh December"".

Taylor continues to create music with her band and tour under her own independent label Bicycle Records. She is supported by her fan base, who in 2010 raised over £9000 to help her promote her work and fund her tours.''""Without the people who buy my music and support the gigs and concerts I would never have got this far. Being an independent artist, making the kind of music I do, and competing with the more commercial and larger labels can be fiercely overwhelming at times!  But then I'll get an incredible email from someone who's connected with the music or have the most wonderful feedback after a gig and I couldn't ever think about doing anything else!!""''  Jane Taylor

Clare Teal,"Teal was brought up in the Kildwick area of Yorkshire. She developed an interest in jazz from an early age, through her father's collection of 78rpm records, becoming ""obsessed"" with big band singers like Ella Fitzgerald and big bands like Joe Loss. She took music lessons, first on the electronic organ, then more formally on clarinet, before studying music at Wolverhampton University. While at university, Teal found herself without a clarinet for an unexpected examination. Deciding to sing instead, she not only got her ""best grades ever"", but discovered that she loved singing in public. After graduation, she started a career in advertising, singing in her spare time with amateur and semi-professional bands.","Teal's break came when she was asked to stand in for Stacey Kent at a weekend festival in Llandrindod Wells. This led (after some determined self-promotion, in which she drew upon her advertising skills) to a three-album contract with the jazz label Candid Records. Her popularity soared, with appearances on radio and television bringing her to the attention of a wider public, and in 2004 she released her first album for Sony Jazz in what was the biggest recording deal by any British jazz singer. Don't Talk topped the jazz charts and entered the UK Top 20 UK Albums Chart.

While the majority of her recordings are cover versions of standards, her albums feature original songs and contemporary cover versions, notably a cover of ""California Dreaming"" by The Mamas & the Papas. This song attracted the attention of BBC Radio presenter Michael Parkinson, garnering significant publicity during her period with Candid Records.

Teal has toured throughout the UK and the world, with her pianist, trio, mini big band, or Hollywood Orchestra. She has worked with the Hallé Orchestra, BBC Concert Orchestra, RTÉ Concert Orchestra, and the John Wilson Orchestra as well as other top big bands. In August 2017, she produced and presented her third concert for The Proms. Swing No End featured two big bands and many special guests. It was broadcast on BBC Radio 2, BBC Radio 3, and televised on BBC Four.

From 2006-2013 Teal presented the BBC Radio 2 show, Big Band Special. In 2009 she started presenting her own show on BBC Radio 2. She has appeared as a presenter on Friday Night is Music Night. Since 2 August 2009, she has presented Sunday Night at 10, took over from Malcolm Laycock. She writes a weekly blog for The Yorkshire Post.

Her final show for BBC Radio 2 was broadcast on Sunday 3 January 2021. From Sunday 24 January 2021 she has joined Jazz FM for a new two-hour swing and big band show.

Teal collaborated with Van Morrison on the single ""Carrying a Torch"" from his album Duets: Reworking the Catalogue. She was the opening act for Liza Minnelli at Kenwood House and the Royal Festival Hall. She performed at the Glastonbury Festival and the Marlborough Jazz Festival.","

Jade Thirlwall,"Thirlwall was born and raised in the Laygate area of South Shields, Tyne and Wear. She is the daughter of Norma Badwi and James Thirlwall and has an older brother named Karl Thirlwall. She is of Egyptian and Yemeni descent from her mother's side and of English descent from her father's side. She auditioned for The X Factor in 2008 and 2010 but was eliminated at the bootcamp stage. She attended performing arts college South Tyneside, where she studied a range of courses. As a teenager, Thirlwall experienced racism and bullying which later contributed to her suffering with anorexia for five years before beginning her recovery.","Thirlwall first auditioned on The X Factor in 2008, but got no further than bootcamp. She then returned in 2011, performing the song ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" by the Beatles. Thirlwall earned four ""yes"" votes and went through to bootcamp. After she failed the first bootcamp challenge to progress through to the Girls category (solo females aged 16–24), Thirlwall was then placed in a three-piece group named ""Orion"" alongside Leigh-Anne Pinnock. Perrie Edwards and Jesy Nelson were in another group called ""Faux Pas"". Both groups, however were eliminated. The four were then called back by the judges and were later formed into the four-piece group Rhythmix, and they progressed to judges' houses. They eventually reached the live shows and were mentored and loved by Tulisa Contostavlos. On 28 October 2011, it was announced that the band's new name would be Little Mix. On 11 December 2011, Little Mix were announced as the winners, making them the first band ever to win the show. In April 2019, Thirlwall along with Pinnock, signed to Sony/ATV via joint venture TwentySeven as published songwriters.

Thirlwall has released six albums with the band; DNA (2012), Salute (2013), Get Weird (2015), Glory Days (2016), LM5 (2018) and Confetti (2020).

Linda Thompson (singer),"Born in Hackney, London, she moved with her family to her mother's home city of Glasgow, Scotland, at the age of six. Actor Brian Pettifer is her brother. Around 1966 she started singing in folk clubs, and in 1967 began studying modern languages at the University of London, but dropped out after four months. She changed her name to Linda Peters. By day she sang advertising jingles, including one with Manfred Mann. She recorded the Bob Dylan song ""You Ain't Goin' Nowhere"", released as an MGM single in 1968 by Paul McNeill and Linda Peters, McNeill being another friend of Sandy Denny and Alex Campbell. They released a second single as Paul and Linda in 1969 on Page One, featuring the John D. Loudermilk song ""You're Taking My Bag"". She met Richard Thompson in 1969, but they did not record together until 1972.

Her reputation led to her being invited to join the Bunch, a loose supergroup of folk rock artists including former Fairport Convention members Sandy Denny, Richard Thompson, and Ashley Hutchings which recorded an album called Rock On. This was a set of 1950s rock and roll classics. A single was released from the album: The Everly Brothers' hit ""When Will I Be Loved"", which was a duet by Linda and Sandy. A second single was released soon afterwards ""The Loco-Motion"", sung by Linda alone. Two versions exist, one with ""Sweet Little Rock 'n' Roller"" as the B-side and in a picture sleeve, another with ""Don't Be Cruel"" on the flip. Later in 1972 Linda and Richard were backing singers on Sandy Denny's solo album Sandy.

Linda teamed up with Simon Nicol and Richard (after he had left Fairport Convention). Calling themselves ""Hokey Pokey"", they toured as a trio. Linda and Richard married in 1972. Linda sang on Fairport's album Rosie (1973), credited as Linda Peters.

The next album, I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight (1974) was credited to ""Richard and Linda Thompson"". Two albums followed in 1975: Hokey Pokey and Pour Down Like Silver. Richard had started to take an interest in Sufism, a mystical form of Islam, in 1973. After the tour, the couple went to a Sufi commune in East Anglia for six months, then to another in Maida Vale. Richard announced that he would never play again, but returned after three years. Linda found herself in a community where all the food was prepared by the women. In her words, the members were ""white middle-class people trying to punish themselves, and everybody else. It taught me a lot. To stay away from sects, mostly.""Their come-back album was called First Light (1978). Richard's writing has a strong thread of disdain for fame, wealth and worldly values and attacks political hypocrisy, often in wildly abstract metaphors. Sunnyvista followed in 1979, and Shoot Out the Lights in 1982.

Shoot Out The Lights was surprisingly successful in America, and the Thompsons, despite the fractured state of their relationship, were offered a long and lucrative tour of the U.S. Simon Nicol described the final tour, in the summer of 1982, as being ""like walking on a tightrope"", and that as a result the first thing he did on stage was ""look for the exit"". The couple had separated by the time that the American tour started, and were barely speaking to each other.

The penultimate date of the tour was in Los Angeles. Linda then went to stay with her friend Linda Ronstadt. The tapes were finally released in October 2010 in the Shoot Out The Lights box set, although a version of ""Walking on a Wire"" from earlier in the tour is on the Free Reed RT boxed set. When Richard left Linda, she had just given birth to their third child, Kamila.Linda lost her voice for the next two years as a result of spasmodic dysphonia. She made a new start in 1984, singing with ""The Home Service"" at the National Theatre's production of medieval mystery plays and in 1985 she released her solo album One Clear Moment, then fell silent for eleven years. One song from the album, called ""Telling Me Lies"", written with Betsy Cook, was recorded by Emmylou Harris, Dolly Parton, and Linda Ronstadt for their Trio album in 1987. The recording was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Country Song category. Linda retired from music to run an antique jewellery shop in Bond Street, central London. She married Steve Kenis, an American who was an agent for recording artists. In 1985 Richard married U.S. folk club organiser, Nancy Covey.

A compilation of Linda's earlier work, Dreams Fly Away (1996), included both previously released songs and alternate versions of some of her better-known songs. It was received politely but did not sell well. In 1999, Linda's mother died. This provoked an outpouring of sorrow and regenerated her determination to sing. Linda was diagnosed with spasmodic dysphonia, preventing her from singing. A temporary cure was found. By having botox injected into her throat, she could regain her normal singing voice for a few months. Give Me a Sad Song (2001) was positively reviewed. In 2002, she released a new CD, Fashionably Late, which featured several family members, including her son Teddy Thompson and daughter Kamila Thompson, as well as an appearance on one song by Richard Thompson.

Linda appeared along with her son Teddy, her friends The McGarrigles, and Kate McGarrigle's children Martha Wainwright and Rufus Wainwright (amongst others) in Hal Wilner's ""Came So Far For Beauty"" tribute concerts to the music of Leonard Cohen from 2003 to 2006. Linda sang the Cohen songs ""A Thousand Kisses Deep"" and ""Alexandra Leaving"". She appeared again with Teddy Thompson with The McGarrigles and Wainwrights for some of their family concerts, including the McGarrigle Christmas shows. In 2007, Linda released yet another set of original songs and covers, Versatile Heart. Like Fashionably Late, this too was primarily a collaboration with son Teddy Thompson, and the CD also features a supporting cast of family and friends. The CD was well received in the press. The CD opens and closes with two arrangements of a Teddy Thompson instrumental piece, ""Stay Bright"", the first an acoustic version, and the second a version for string quartet arranged by famed Nick Drake collaborator Robert Kirby. She contributed vocals to the Primal Scream album Beautiful Future (2008), on the track ""Over & Over"".

Linda and Richard Thompson performed a duet at 12 June 2010 Meltdown Festival tribute concert to Kate McGarrigle, which Richard coordinated.

Linda's fourth solo album, Won't Be Long Now, was released on 15 October 2013. The album features compositions and backing vocals from Teddy Thompson and his sisters as well as guitar work by Richard Thompson.

Linda appears on the album Family (2014) by the band Thompson (named for all the Thompsons that appear) having written two songs for the project. The album was produced by her son Teddy Thompson and features Richard Thompson and The Rails, who are Linda's daughter Kamila Thompson and her husband James Walbourne, as well as other related musicians, including Walbourne's brother and Richard Thompson's son from his second marriage.",N/A,"Richard and Linda Thompson

Martha Tilston,"Martha Tilston is the daughter of singer-songwriter Steve Tilston and stepdaughter of Irish folk performer Maggie Boyle. Trained as an artist and dramatist, she began her musical career in 2000 as an active presence in Britain's alternative festival scene, particularly as part of the travelling troupe called the Small World Solar Stage. She formed the duo Mouse with guitarist Nick Marshall, releasing two albums, Helicopter Trees (2000) and Mouse Tales (2001) and touring as a supporting act with Damien Rice. Her first solo album, Rolling, was issued in 2002 on her own label, Squiggly, followed by Bimbling in 2004.

Tilston's next album, Ropeswing (2005), featured an expanded group of backing musicians named The Woods and was available as a free download. It contains her two most politically explicit songs, ""Artificial"", which speaks of the deadliness of office life, and ""Corporations"", which is a critique of corporate rule and the corporate-education complex. She has also appeared on several compilations, including her song ""The Saddest Game"" about child soldiers in Africa on The Big Issue's Peace Not War CD. Her song ""Good World"" is among several that she has written and performed on environmental subjects. However, much of her work is not political, focusing instead on personal freedom, love, inner peace and the natural world. Songs such as ""Simple"" on Ropeswing, ""By the Lake"" on Mouse Tales and ""Firefly"" on Bimbling are examples of these.

Tilston's album Of Milkmaids and Architects was released in late 2006. She was nominated for Best New Act in the 2007 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards contest.

Throughout her career Tilston has played regularly throughout Britain, ranging from unaccompanied solo gigs to larger concerts with up to six-piece backing band The Woods. She also toured Australia in 2008. Following a maternity break she resumed playing live in April 2009, appearing on the fourth Zero 7 studio album Yeah Ghost.

Tilston released two albums of largely self-penned songs (Lucy and the Wolves in 2010 and Machines of Love And Grace in 2012). In 2014, she released an album The Sea consisting of traditional English folk songs about the sea, largely reflecting her family's strong musical traditions and involving her family and friends in the performances.",N/A,"

Caroline Trevor,N/A,"Trevor's first musical experience was singing in a church choir led by her father. She has performed frequently with the singers and players of the Taverner Consort, conducted by Andrew Parrott. They recorded Bach cantatas such as Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4.

Since March 1982 Trevor has been one of two regular singers in the alto section of the a cappella ensemble The Tallis Scholars. As of 3 November 2003, she had performed 800 concerts with the group, which had then given 1297 concerts; their 2000th concert was in September 2015. She is the wife of the ensemble's founder and director Peter Phillips. The Tallis Scholars have focused on rarely performed music from the Renaissance to contemporary. One example is their recording of three masses based on the same ""Western Wind"" secular tune, Western Wind Masses, by Tudor composers John Taverner, Christopher Tye and John Sheppard. She has performed internationally with the ensemble, which has won prizes including Gramophone Awards during her tenure. The Tallis Scholars celebrated their 25th anniversary in 1998 with a tour that included concerts at New York's Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, singing music by English composers of the Tudor period (Thomas Tallis, William Byrd, and William Mundy, among others), and by continental composers such as Palestrina and Nicolas Gombert. James R. Oestreich of The New York Times noted that the group's ""characteristic sound, bright, clear and balanced, has become a model for many other choirs"".

Trevor appeared as a soloist on a 1989 recording, Elizabethan Christmas Anthems, with the ensembles Red Byrd and the Rose Consort of Viols, singing William Byrd's Lullaby. She subsequently was the soloist with the Rose Consort of Viols and lutenist Jacob Heringman on a 1992 recording, John Dowland's Lachrimae. In 2011, she was the first woman to be engaged by St Paul's Cathedral in London for a singing position in the traditionally male cathedral choir, breaking the tradition of male voices only which had been observed for nine centuries.",N/A,N/A,English contralto,1958,N/A,N/A,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Trevor

Tulisa,"Tula Paulinea Contostavlos was born on 13 July 1988 in Camden Town, London. Her Irish mother, Anne Byrne, was born in Churchtown, Dublin. Anne and her three sisters went on to form the 1980s big band and swing band Jeep. Tulisa's father, Plato Contostavlos, is Greek Cypriot and at one time was keyboardist with Mungo Jerry. Plato's brother, Byron Contostavlos, was bassist with Mungo Jerry and later became manager of N-Dubz. Despite being baptised in her father's Greek Orthodox faith, Tulisa later became a practising Roman Catholic.

When Tulisa was five, her mother, who has bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorder, was sectioned under the Mental Health Act. The 2010 BBC programme, Tulisa: My Mum And Me, described Tulisa's life looking after her mother before joining N-Dubz. At age 14, with support from her uncle, Byron Contostavlos, she enrolled at Quintin Kynaston School in St John's Wood but later attended Haverstock Secondary School where she did not sit her GCSE examinations.","

Dappy and Fazer, who had already started rapping together, decided they wanted a female voice in the group, which was called the Lickle Rinsers Crew at the time, and so invited Tulisa to be part of the group. They started performing together as a group around Camden from young ages. Performing as the Lickle Rinsers Crew, they released the singles ""Bad Man Riddim"" and ""Life Is Getting Sicker by the Day"", which became hits on pirate radio stations. After Lickle Rinsers Crew, they then became NW1, after the area they hail from, making their first music video in 2005 for the track ""Everyday Of My Life"", which received airplay on Channel U, recording more demos as NW1 such as ""Don't Feel Like Moving"", ""Girl On Road"" and ""Livin Broke"". Their first single to be released was ""You Better Not Waste My Time"", which was available for download only until their 2006 self-released single, ""I Swear"", which gained them their first mainstream notice. In 2007, the group appeared on the UK charts with ""Feva Las Vegas"" (also self-released), peaking at number 57.



On 6 August 2008, it was announced that the group had left Polydor Records and had signed to All Around the World records. The press release stated that the label would be releasing ""Ouch"" as the group's first single on the label in September 2008. The group's first album, Uncle B, was released on 17 November 2008. ""Strong Again"" was touted as the third single to be released from Uncle B and charted for five weeks in the UK Singles Chart, peaking highest at number 24. Due to the success of their debut album, the group embarked on their first headlining tour, Uncle B tour. The tour was supported by Stevie Hoang and Tinchy Stryder with whom N-Dubz collaborated on his number one single ""Number 1"". During one performance, Tulisa fainted on stage.

The lead single from the group's second album titled ""I Need You"" was released on 9 November 2009 and charted at number five in the UK. The album, Against All Odds, was released on 16 November 2009, and charted at number six in the UK Album Chart. It went platinum within approximately two months of release. The second single, ""Playing with Fire"", features R&B/pop musician, Mr Hudson, and reached number 15 in the UK charts on album downloads alone. In 2010, N-Dubz toured their album, Against All Odds, starting on 31 March and finishing on 20 April.

After much speculation, it was confirmed that US label Def Jam signed the group. The first release was N-Dubz's third studio album, Love.Live.Life. It was released in the UK on 29 November 2010. The group began recording the album following the success of Against All Odds. ""We Dance On"" was released on 20 May 2010, as the album's lead single. It peaked at number five in the UK. The song was also included on the soundtrack to the film Streetdance 3D. ""Best Behaviour"" was released on 17 October 2010 as the second single from the album. It peaked at number 10 in both the UK and Scotland and became a top 40 hit in Ireland. ""Girls"" was released as the album's third single on 12 December 2010. It reached number 19 in the UK.

N-Dubz parted ways with record label Def Jam in August 2011 due to creative differences. The band performed their final gig together in September, with Dappy releasing his solo single ""No Regrets"" soon after.In 2011, Tulisa replaced Cheryl Cole as a judge for the eighth series of The X Factor. Tulisa mentored the Groups category, which included 4-piece girlband Little Mix (formerly known as Rhythmix). Despite three of her four acts being eliminated in the first five weeks of the competition, Little Mix went on to become the most successful girl group in X Factor history, avoiding the final showdown every week and winning the show in the process, making them the first band to do so in its eight-year history. Tulisa returned for the ninth series in 2012. Tulisa mentored the ""Girls"", a category made up of female contestants aged 16–27, which included Lucy Spraggan and Ella Henderson. Tulisa did not join the tenth series of the show in 2013 and was replaced by Sharon Osbourne. The singer briefly returned to The X Factor for its eleventh series as Louis Walsh's guest judge during the judges' houses stage in Bermuda. She also appeared on the first night of the final temporarily filling in for Mel B who was ill.



In March 2012, a six-minute sex tape of Tulisa and her former boyfriend Justin Edwards emerged on the internet. Tulisa was granted an injunction that legally blocks the distribution of the tape. In the aftermath she recorded a video response on her YouTube account, stating that she was both heartbroken and devastated by Edwards' release of the video. In July, she settled with Edwards but continued to pursue action against Edwards' former manager Chris Herbert, who had his job as a consultant on The X Factor suspended.

Tulisa released her solo album, The Female Boss, on 3 December 2012, for which she began working on earlier that year. She described the album as having ""a track for every mood,"" with songs meant for parties, big ballads and ""UK urban music."" The first single released from the album was ""Young"", released in April and accompanied by a promotional video filmed in Miami. The song charted at number five on the Irish Singles Chart and number one in the UK. September saw the release of the second single ""Live It Up"". The song debuted at number 11 in the UK. Around this time, Tulisa released an autobiography titled Honest: My Story So Far. Tulisa's third solo single ""Sight of You"" was released together with the album to mostly negative reviews and charted lower than expected at number 18. The album itself received negative reviews and charted at number 35. In January 2013, Tulisa stated that the album campaign had finished and that no further singles would be released.

Released in November 2012 Britney Spears and will.i.am's single ""Scream & Shout"" was originally co-written by Tulisa with Jean Baptiste and recorded under the title ""I Don't Give a Fuck"". The track was intended for Tulisa's debut album. However, the producer of the track, Lazy Jay, did not want Tulisa to have the song and gave it to will.i.am, who re-wrote the song with Spears in mind. The song became a hit, peaking at number one in the UK and number three in the US. Despite Tulisa's vocals still being heard on ""Scream & Shout"", she was not credited with co-writing the song upon its release, which prevented her from collecting any royalties. Tulisa filed a lawsuit against will.i.am and won in 2018, entitling her to 10% of publishing rights.Tulisa began working on a second album in 2013, and continued to record throughout 2014  The single, ""Living Without You"", was initially planned for release in December 2014, but was eventually released in January the next year. The single peaked at number 44 in the UK. That single was followed two years later by ""Sweet Like Chocolate"", which featured rapper Akelle.

In 2016, Tulisa signed with an agent in an attempt to begin a career as a film actress, and as of 2018 she is committed to star as Sista C in the upcoming feature film Diva. She had earlier acted with roles such as the role of Laurissa, a cocaine addict who is in R&B group, in the television series Dubplate Drama (2007–09), Shaniqua in the straight-to-DVD British comedy, Big Fat Gypsy Gangster (2011), and Amber in the British slasher film Demons Never Die (2011).

In April 2019, Tulisa released her first single in three years, ""Daddy"", after signing to Xploded Records, which was founded by the co-founders of All Around the World. Another single, ""Sippin'"" was released two months later.","

Diana Vickers,"Vickers was born in Blackburn, Lancashire, England. She studied for A Levels in Theatre Studies, Classics and Psychology at Westholme School in Blackburn. Vickers has been singing since the age of 11, taking singing lessons and participating in local competitions, but did not sing professionally before adulthood.","In 2008 Vickers auditioned for the fifth series of The X Factor, singing ""The Blower's Daughter"" by Damien Rice, after which Louis Walsh commented that she resembled a ""little hippie"". Vickers was selected for the live shows and was mentored by Cheryl Cole in the girls' category alongside Alexandra Burke and Laura White.

Vickers' live show performances attracted both praise and criticism. While on the show, she often performed with bare feet. Vickers additionally gained attention for her hand gestures on stage coining the nickname ""The Claw"".

On her first live show, Vickers sang U2's ""With or Without You"" and in her second live show Michael Jackson's ""Man in the Mirror"", for which she received praise from Dannii Minogue, describing it as ""box fresh"", with Simon Cowell remarking she was ""the one to beat"". The following week Vickers performed Charlie Chaplin's ""Smile"" and in week four Blondie's ""Call Me"", which again received praise from the judges. In week five of the live show stages, Vickers did not perform due to a bout of laryngitis. She had wanted to perform the Mariah Carey song ""Always Be My Baby"", but her doctor advised her not to, saying Vickers could do permanent damage to her vocal cords. This was the first time on the show that the producers had excused any act from performing.

In week six, Vickers returned to the programme performing Coldplay's ""Yellow"", which received a negative reaction from the judges; Dannii Minogue commented that she didn’t ""love the song choice"", while Cowell suggested Vickers was still not well enough to perform. In week seven, Vickers performed Take That's ""Patience"" commenting that she now felt 100%.

In the semi-final of the competition, Vickers performed Avril Lavigne's ""Girlfriend"" as her first song and received positive comments from the judges, including Cheryl Cole's comment that ""she had got that sparkle back"". Vickers followed this with Dido's ""White Flag"" but was voted out of the competition. She performed a reprise of ""White Flag"", where her fellow singers joined her on stage in a memorably emotional moment. She achieved fourth place overall. Following the end of the series, she went on tour with the rest of the final eight contestants on The X Factor Live tour between February and March 2009.Vickers signed to Sony Music's RCA Records. She began work on her debut album in January 2009, commenting that it would not be rushed and that it would be ""Diana style"". She worked with Cathy Dennis, Eg White, Nerina Pallot, Ellie Goulding, Guy Sigsworth, Chris Braide, Savan Kotecha, Starsmith, Patrick Wolf, and Dev Hynes.

In March 2010, Vickers' first leg of the Songs from the Tainted Cherry Tree Tour took place, followed by a second leg in May 2010 to coincide with the release of her debut album, Songs from the Tainted Cherry Tree, which charted at number one on the UK Albums Chart. Songs from the Tainted Cherry Tree has since been certified gold by the BPI for sales of 100,000 copies. Vickers' debut single, ""Once"", was written by Cathy Dennis and Eg White and produced by Mike Spencer. The track was released in the United Kingdom in April 2010 and playlisted on Radio 1, where Vickers performed an acoustic version of ""Once"" and a cover of Snow Patrol's ""Just Say Yes"" for the Live Lounge. ""Once"" entered the UK Singles Chart at number one. ""The Boy Who Murdered Love"", written and produced by Chris Braide (with lyric contribution from Vickers), was released as the second single and charted at number 36 in the UK. During mid 2010, Vickers performed at numerous music festivals such as the Freedom Festival, iTunes Festival, Oxygen Festival, Radio 1's Big Weekend, Summer Sundae, T in the Park, T4 on the Beach, and V Festival. Vickers also supported Mika at the Eden Sessions in June 2010.

Vickers' third single was a previously unheard track titled ""My Wicked Heart"", co-written by Vickers and producers Dee Adams and James Earp, which features Vickers playing the trumpet. The single was released in October 2010 and reached number 13 in the UK; the same month, it was reported that Red Hot Chili Peppers was considering legal action over similarities between the chorus of the band's well-known song ""Under the Bridge"" and ""My Wicked Heart"". Vickers said in an interview that she had been listening to ""Under the Bridge"" shortly before working on ""My Wicked Heart"" and had noticed but decided to ignore the similarities. In an interview to promote the single, Vickers announced the possibility of Songs from the Tainted Cherry Tree getting a solely digital download re-release, and also stated, ""I've been writing so much and got so many tracks under my belt. I think I'm very close to ready for the second album actually."" The fourth leg of the Songs from the Tainted Cherry Tree Tour began in November 2010 and included dates in Ireland as well as the UK. At the end of 2010, Vickers became RCA's highest grossing domestic artist.In June 2010, Vickers announced that she had started preparing songs for a second album. She co-wrote material with musicians such as Nerina Pallot, Eg White, Starsmith, Chris Braide, and Dee Adam. In January 2011, Vickers travelled to Los Angeles, United States, to co-write material with John Shanks and Diane Warren, and played her debut USA gig at Cherry Pop in West Hollywood (promoted via Perez Hilton).

Vickers co-wrote the 2011 Enrique Iglesias and Jennifer Lopez single ""Mouth 2 Mouth"" for Iglesias's reissue album Euphoria Reloaded.

In June 2011, Vickers revealed on her official Tumblr account that she had parted company with RCA Records due to creative differences. It was later reported that her departure was due to wanting to pursue a more indie, less commercial route, coupled with a breakdown in her professional relationship with Sony Music due to the departure from RCA Records of Craig Logan, who had originally signed Vickers to the label. Vickers released two new tracks, ""Music to Make Boys Cry"" and ""Kiss of a Bullet"", for free download online in December 2011. In February 2012, she showcased material from her second album in a mini-tour at The Ruby Lounge in Manchester and Cargo in Shoreditch, London. She signed a worldwide record deal with So Recordings in early 2013.

Vickers' second album, Music to Make Boys Cry, was released in September 2013, later than anticipated due to Vickers starring in an independent film titled The Perfect Wave. The album charted at number 37 on the UK Albums Chart and reached the top ten on the UK Indie Chart. The lead single, ""Cinderella"", was released in July 2013 and charted in the top 20 of the UK Indie Chart; the second single, ""Music to Make Boys Cry"", coincided with the album's release in September. Vickers promoted the album during the 2013 music festival season with appearances at Festival Too, Liverpool International Music Festival, T in the Park, and V Festival; for some of these performances she opened for fellow The X Factor alumnus Olly Murs. The third single from Music to Make Boys Cry, ""Mad at Me"", was released in December.

In 2013, Vickers appeared as the lead in a music video for the single ""Derail"" by Leeds rock band Dinosaur Pile-Up. In the music video, Vickers plays the part of a kidnapped girl who subsequently kills a man in the shower after the kidnapping. The same year, Vickers was featured singing on the One Direction television advertisement for the launch of their debut fragrance, Our Moment. Vickers sings a cover of ""My Favourite Things"", a song from the musical The Sound of Music.

Lately dedicated in her career in acting, Vickers' launched in August 2015 the song ""Chains"", which was used to promote the film Awaiting.","

Amy Wadge,"Wadge was born and brought up in Backwell, a small village just outside Bristol, England. Her father's passion for music influenced her enormously, and on the subject of her paternal influences she has said that she ""grew up listening to early Elton John, Joni Mitchell and James Taylor. That was the stuff I cut my teeth on and now I listen to everything you can possibly imagine from hip hop to country"".

She began to write her own songs at the age of 9 on the family piano. When she was 11, her parents bought her her first guitar from a junk shop. It was when Wadge taught herself to play along to Tracy Chapman's debut album that she discovered her affinity for the guitar.

While still at school, Wadge regularly gigged around Bristol. At the age of 14, she signed her first record deal, along with her band Two uv a Mind. She released her first single at the age of 16.","Apart from writing songs for herself, Wadge has been active in collaborating with new performers in Britain, most notably Ed Sheeran. The two collaborated on a number of songs, and Sheeran titled his self-released 2010 EP Songs I Wrote with Amy. One track was included with the deluxe edition of Sheeran's album +. Wadge continued her collaborative relationship with Sheeran in 2014. The single ""Thinking Out Loud"", written on a guitar given to Sheeran, features on the album x.

She was quickly spotted and received encouragement from some of the big players in the city, among them Manics/Catatonia/Super Furry Animals producer Greg Haver, who recorded her debut mini-album, The Famous Hour. This album ""brought her more attention and acclaim"". She played alongside Stereophonics, Embrace and Lenny Kravitz at the launch party for BBC 6 Music.

Katie Waissel,"Waissel is Jewish. In September 2012, she married male model Brad Alphonso; they divorced after two months of marriage. In 2015, she married comedian Brian Moote; they split in late 2016. In July 2018, she gave birth to her first child, a boy named Hudson. In September 2018, she split from her boyfriend.","In mid-to-late 2009, Waissel starred in an interactive, online reality show Green Eyed World, sponsored by Sprite. The show focused on her journey in the US and Europe in hopes of a record label in 14 episodes of roughly 5 minutes in length each. Sprite experimented with the world's first YouTube/Facebook digital connection.

During her time on the show, Waissel shot a music video for her song ""Live and Learn"", and released a five-track EP, Songs from Under the Covers under ""KatieVRecords"". A song recorded at the time, a duet with The Private Life of David Reed ""Moving Mountains"", later appeared on their self-titled album during her time on The X Factor under the alias ""Lola Fontaine"". Waissel has been on tour with East 17 and Andy Abraham Sometime after the show, Waissel performed in Hollywood for Paris Hilton together with friend and fellow contestant X Factor Storm Lee.Before auditioning for The X Factor, Waissel had worked as a receptionist, waitress and once worked at OK! magazine. At her audition, she wanted to sing ""At Last"" by Etta James, but Simon made her pick another song before she even started singing. Eventually, after failing to remember ""We are the Champions,"" she was allowed to sing her original song. She then sang ""At Last"" by Etta James, and was put through to bootcamp by Cheryl and Simon Cowell. At bootcamp, she sang ""Make You Feel My Love"" and reacted with shock when she was the first girl put through to the judges houses. She fell to pieces when performing the song ""Smile"" in front of Cheryl and will.i.am at the judges' houses stage, and had to stop to compose herself after crying, stating that ""it's an emotional song for me"".< Despite stumbling through her song for the second time, Cheryl picked her as one of her final three girls.

In week 1 of the live shows, she sang ""We Are the Champions"". She was put in the bottom three as a result of the public vote, but because Nicolo Festa polled the fewest votes, Waissel had to sing in the final showdown with F.Y.D., the other bottom three act from week 1. She sang ""Don't Let Me Down"" in the final showdown and was saved from elimination by the judges by a majority vote, with only Cowell (F.Y.D.'s mentor) voting against her while Cole, Dannii Minogue and Louis Walsh voted to save Waissel. Voting statistics revealed that F.Y.D. received more votes than Waissel meaning if Walsh sent the result to deadlock, F.Y.D. would’ve been saved. In the second week of the live shows, Katie sang ""I'd Rather Go Blind"". She managed to avoid the bottom three this week and secured a place to the third week, where she sang ""I Wan'na Be Like You"". In the fourth week she sang ""Bewitched"" and was in the final showdown with Belle Amie. The result went to deadlock this time, but Waissel was announced as safe when it was revealed that Belle Amie had the fewest votes. She was in the final showdown again the next week after performing ""Don't Speak"" but was saved by a majority vote over Treyc Cohen when Cole refused to vote against either acts of hers but wanted to vote last to send the result to deadlock but wasn't allowed to. Cowell and Walsh voted to eliminate Cohen and only Minogue voted to eliminate Waissel. Voting statistics revealed that Cohen received more votes than Waissel meaning if Cole was allowed to send the result to deadlock, Cohen would have been saved.

Waissel was in the final showdown for a third successive week when she sang ""Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting"", and this had been the fourth time Waissel had been in the final showdown. The result went to deadlock, but the public vote showed Aiden Grimshaw received fewer votes and he was eliminated. This was the first time in the show's history that a contestant was put into the final showdown four times and survived. In the quarter-final, she performed ""Sex on Fire"" and ""Everybody Hurts"". In the series' third double elimination, Waissel received the fewest votes and was automatically eliminated.

Jessie Ware,"Ware was born at Queen Charlotte's Hospital in Hammersmith, London, on 15 October 1984. She was raised in Clapham, London. She is the daughter of Helena (née Keell, usually called Lennie ), a social worker, and John Ware, a BBC Panorama reporter, who divorced when she was 10. She is the younger sister of English actress Hannah Ware. Her mother was supportive in her early musical career and Ware considers her to be ""her hero"", saying ""She brought up my sister, brother and me with so much love and fun and always told me I could do anything I want."" Ware's mother is Jewish and she was raised in the faith.

Ware was educated at Alleyn's School, a co-educational independent school in Dulwich in South London, where she was a schoolmate of Florence Welch, Jack Peñate, and Felix White of the Maccabees. She then attended the University of Sussex, where she graduated with a degree in English literature. After her studies, Ware briefly worked as a journalist at The Jewish Chronicle, did sports journalism at The Daily Mirror and worked behind the scenes at TV company Love Productions. There, she was a colleague of Erika Leonard, otherwise known as E. L. James, the author of Fifty Shades of Grey.","In the years prior to releasing her first solo album, Ware did backing vocals at live shows for Jack Peñate (who took her on tour in the U.S.) and Man Like Me. Ware said she learned a lot during her time with Jack Peñate: ""Performing with him was really good training, because I got to learn all about how other people do it – I was able to perform live without the pressure of being a lead singer. It gave me a taste of what to expect, and it prepared me for what I’m doing now.""

One of Peñate's bandmates, Tic, first introduced Ware to SBTRKT; Ware and SBTRKT went on to collaborate on 'Nervous' (2010). She consequently met Sampha, then known as SBTRKT's main collaborator. They created ""Valentine"" together, which was released on a special edition, heart-shaped vinyl by Young Turks in 2011. ""Valentine"" was partly inspired by James Blake's song ""The Wilhelm Scream"" and based on their own personal experiences in love. The music video for ""Valentine"" was directed by Marcus Söderlund. ""Nervous"", ""Valentine"" and an additional collaboration with DJ Joker (""The Vision"") led Ware to a record deal with PMR Records. She also featured on Ceremonials, the 2011 album by Florence and the Machine in which her good friend Florence Welch is lead singer.

On 14 October 2011, Ware released her debut solo single ""Strangest Feeling"" on limited 10"" purple vinyl, although the song did not chart in the United Kingdom.On 20 August 2012, Ware released her debut album Devotion, which peaked at number five on the UK Albums Chart.

Ware played the Wilderness Festival (7–10 August 2014); a pair of additional dates at Berlin Festival 2014 (6 July 2014) and Sopot Gulf of Art (26 July 2014) that year.

Ware contributed a song for Nicki Minaj's third studio album, The Pinkprint (2014), called ""The Crying Game"" in which Minaj alternates between ""devastating verses and pensive crooning"" whilst Ware adds ""haunting"" and ""soulful"" vocals to the chorus. Originally, Ware only received a songwriting credit, but she was then credited on updated versions of the album. She also co-wrote the song ""New Man"" for Ed Sheeran's third album ÷ and provided background vocals on it and two other songs.

In October 2017, Ware returned to the stage after a two-year absence in anticipation of the release of her third studio album Glasshouse. Featuring contribution from Francis and the Lights, Ed Sheeran, Cashmere Cat, Julia Michaels and others, it was preceded by its first three singles ""Midnight"", ""Selfish Love"" and ""Alone"".

Summer Watson,N/A,"Watson's initial idea was to join an opera company, but things took a different turn as world music clubs began to spread a new international trend of mixing classical and popular music. Equally at home giving a classical recital in traditional surroundings or singing in a club with a couple of young non-classical musicians, Watson realised she might be able to make a record that would reflect this diversity and bring together the best of different genres.

Having graduated from the Royal College of Music, Watson went on to sign a £1 million recording contract with Sony Classical in 2002. The programme of her self-titled debut album Summer, created by Watson herself and producer Nick Patrick, is a collection of classical, popular and world music, including pieces and arrangements of music by Ludwig van Beethoven, Antonín Dvořák, Gabriel Fauré, Geminiano Giacomelli, Benjamin Godard, Ennio Morricone, Stanley Myers, Joaquín Rodrigo, Sting, Richard Strauss and others.

The album was recorded at Abbey Road Studios with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted and arranged by Nick Ingman. Other recording studios included Air Lyndhurst and Townhouse Studios, while the London Session Orchestra provided additional strings. Watson worked with various musicians during the recording of the album, including Pino Palladino, Richard Harvey, Nigel Hitchcock, Dominic Miller and John Parricelli. She also had Roger Vignoles as her accompanist in Sposa son disprezzata, and Marcelo Álvarez as her duet partner in Tutta La Vita by Matteo Saggese. Choirs on the album are the London Oratory School Schola and Metro Voices.

Described as a ""seamless fusion between classical and ethnic music that is both emotively powerful and intellectually satisfying"", Summer was released internationally in 2003, peaking at number 1 on the US iTunes and number 2 on the UK Classical Charts. ""Her name says it all—she's bright, blonde and beautiful, with the talent and determination to take the music world by storm – a potential superstar"", declared Classic FM Magazine, while Arena named her as ""the Norah Jones of 2003"". The Daily Express hailed the album as ""very chilled out in a classical way.""

Florence Welch,"Welch considers herself an introvert, and is passionate about reading and literature. She has held many events with her fan-run book club, Between Two Books. ""It’s a huge generalization to say that all readers are introverts; I'm sure there's a lot of extroverted bookworms out there, but, for me, it's nice to know people of similar inclinations can actually come together in a social way and talk about something that is inherently solitary.""

Although many of her songs contain religious themes and elements, Welch has said she does not follow any particular religion. ""I went to Catholic school, and the first songs I remember liking were hymns. I find it's nice to mix the mundane and the magical, the irrelevant with the huge themes. Sex, love, death, marriage, guilt—mix that with seeing a huge sky or going for a walk or turning the page of a book. Living is dealing with the everyday and the notion that you're going to die.""

Welch has been open about her struggles with anxiety and depression, as well as with alcohol. Many of her songs reflect these issues.

In 2015, Welch broke her foot after leaping off the stage at the Coachella Festival. She revealed that she used to drink alcohol before every performance, telling Billboard: ""I'm quite shy, really—that's probably why I used to drink a lot. But I don't anymore. When I finally took time off to make this new record, I had time to strengthen. And when I was coming back into the fray, I really didn't want to lose that. I thought I could go dive-bomb back into it, but look what happened. I dived into it and literally broke myself.""

In 2016, Welch voiced her support for Remain during the EU referendum on that issue. Welch is also a vocal advocate for LGBT rights, and regularly waves the rainbow flag at her concerts, particularly during her song ""Spectrum (Say My Name)"". In 2019, Welch expressed her support for women's rights during concerts in Las Vegas, Nevada, Chicago, Illinois, Raleigh and Columbia, Maryland. She encouraged her audience to donate to the ACLU instead of buying concert merchandise. In 2018, she tweeted her support for the removal of the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland. The removal passed and legalised abortion access within the country.","According to Welch, the band name ""Florence + the Machine"" had ""started off as a private joke that got out of hand. I made music with my friend, who we called Isabella Machine, to which I was Florence Robot. When I was about an hour away from my first gig, I still didn't have a name, so I thought 'Okay, I'll be Florence Robot/Isa Machine', before realising that name was so long it'd drive me mad"". In 2006, Welch's performances with Isabella Summers in small London venues under the joint name Florence Robot/Isa Machine began to attract notice. In 2007, Welch recorded with a band named Ashok, who released an album titled Plans on the Filthy Lucre/About Records label. This album included the earliest version of her later hit ""Kiss with a Fist"", which at this point was titled ""Happy Slap"".

Florence and the Machine released their debut album Lungs in the United Kingdom on 6 July 2009. The album was officially launched with a set at the Rivoli Ballroom in Brockley, South East London. It peaked at number one in the UK and number two in Ireland. As of 6 August 2009, the album had sold over 100,000 copies in the UK and by 10 August it had been at number two for five consecutive weeks. Following its 25 July 2009 release for download in the United States, the album debuted at number seventeen on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart, ultimately peaking at number one. The album was released physically in the US on 20 October by Universal Republic. The album was produced by James Ford, Paul Epworth, Steve Mackey and Charlie Hugall.

Welch contributed vocals to David Byrne and Fatboy Slim's 2010 album Here Lies Love, an album about Imelda Marcos. As of January 2011, Welch was working with Drake on material slated for his upcoming album.

On 27 February 2011, Welch replaced pregnant Dido and sang her portion of Best Original Song nominee ""If I Rise"" (from 127 Hours) with A. R. Rahman at the 83rd Academy Awards.The band's second album, Ceremonials, was released on 31 October 2011. In the album, Florence's ""obsession with drowning"" is represented through the use of repeated water imagery. It debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and number six on the US Billboard 200. On 12 January 2012, Florence and the Machine were nominated for two Brit Awards, with the awards ceremony taking place on 21 February 2012 at the O2 Arena, London. On 26 April 2012, the band released ""Breath of Life"", a song which was recorded as the official theme song for the film Snow White and the Huntsman. On 5 July 2012, a remix of ""Spectrum"" by Scottish musician Calvin Harris was released as the fourth single from Ceremonials, becoming the band's first UK number-one hit. Welch expressed excitement about putting new material together for a third album once the band finished touring at the end of September 2012. Welch led a tribute to Amy Winehouse by performing Winehouse's song ""Back to Black"" and the Annie Lennox-classic Walking on Broken Glass during the VH1 Divas Celebrates Soul concert held in December 2011. The group performed in Times Square on 31 December 2011 for the 40th annual Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve special.

On October 2012, she was featured on Scottish singer-songwriter and producer Calvin Harris' song ""Sweet Nothing"", which debuted at number one on the UK singles chart, marking Welch's second number one. The song was taken from Harris' third studio album 18 Months and is the fifth single from the album. ""Sweet Nothing"" also peaked at number one in Ireland and number two in Australia and New Zealand. ""Sweet Nothing"" was certified Platinum in Australia. ""Sweet Nothing"" received a nomination for Best Dance Recording at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards.

On 29 November 2012 Florence joined the Rolling Stones at the O2 Arena in London to sing ""Gimme Shelter."" Her performance with Mick Jagger was described as ""sexy"" and ""electrifying.""In February 2015, Florence and the Machine announced their third album, How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful, which was released on 1 June 2015. The album reached #1 in many markets including the US, the UK, Australia, and Canada. The record spawned two top 40 UK hits, and earned three Grammy nominations.

During June 2015, Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters broke his leg on stage prior to his band's upcoming Glastonbury Festival headline performance, causing Florence and the Machine to be the headline band. They headlined the festival for the first time on 26 June 2015.

In September 2016, during an interview with Heat Radio, American singer Lady Gaga revealed that she and Florence had recorded a song together. The track, titled ""Hey Girl"", was later featured on Gaga's fifth album Joanne. Footage of their studio session was featured in Gaga's Netflix documentary Gaga: Five Foot Two.

In March 2017, Welch appeared in Song to Song directed by Terrence Malick.

In May 2017, Welch contributed a song titled ""To Be Human"" to the Wonder Woman soundtrack. Co-written with Rick Nowels, the song is performed on the film's soundtrack by Sia and Labrinth.On 12 April 2018, Florence and the Machine released a song titled ""A Sky Full of Song"" and an accompanying music video on YouTube, directed by AG Rojas.

Sarah Whatmore,Whatmore was born in Salford and raised in Walkden.,"Sarah Whatmore rose to fame in the first series of the British television show Pop Idol. Simon Fuller signed her to RCA Records including a worldwide management deal with 19 Entertainment.In 2002 and 2003 she released two singles ""When I Lost You"" and ""Automatic"", respectively, which both reached the Top 20 in the UK Singles Chart. Whatmore was writing for fellow Pop Idol alumni, and spent time working on her debut album, Living Proof.

A third single failed to materialise, and the release of Living Proof was cancelled. Several recordings were leaked over the years, including ""Close To Me"" and ""Don't Let Me Go"".

Turning down the opportunity to become a backing singer for Kylie Minogue to concentrate on her own solo career, Whatmore spent the next five years honing her craft. During the years she wrote more than two hundred songs with various collaborators including Greg Fitzgerald and Peter John Vettese. Whatmore continued to record and write for herself as well as other musicians.

In 2008, she came up with an album of new material. The first single was titled ""Smile"", and was released on 22 September 2008. It contained a sample of Hall & Oates' ""Sara Smile"".

Katie White,"White was raised on a farm in Lowton with her father David K. White, mother Lynne C. (Sharples) and sister Helena. White went to Lowton High School in Lowton, which has a large performing arts department. When White was 12 years old, her grandfather Ken White won £6.6million on the National Lottery and gave each of his three sons, David, Stephen and Richard, £1million. As well as buying ponies for White and her sister Helena, White's father used his share of the money to start a music management company.","White started her music career aged 14 in 1997 in a girl group punk trio TKO, short for technical knock out, with two friends from Lowton school, Joanne Leeson and Emma Lally. TKO was managed by White's father's music management company. They had some success and supported Steps and Atomic Kitten. TKO also appeared on ITV's CD:UK. In March 2001, David White brought in songwriter Jules De Martino, who wrote four songs for TKO. TKO were not able to secure a record deal but released a single on the Internet.White got back in touch with Jules De Martino when she was at Leeds University and he moved to Manchester. They formed a band called Dear Eskiimo (often misreported as Dead Eskimo) with a DJ friend Simon Templeman. The name was intended to be as nomadic, tribal and independent as possible. There were already several bands called ""Eskimo"" but Jules, who wrote the lyrics, wanted his songs to tell good stories as if in a letter, hence ""Dear Eskiimo"" with the odd spelling of 'Eskimo"" with two 'I""s to make it stand out. Their first performance was as a support between two rock bands but it went well and they were signed up by Mercury Records at the end of 2004. Creative differences and the management style of the record label caused them to split up.

White and De Martino started a band in 2007 with White on vocals, guitar, piano and bass drum and De Martino on vocals, drums, bass, guitar and keyboards. They started writing songs together and doing short concerts. White was working in a boutique with a Chinese girl named ""Ting Ting"", which sounds like Mandarin Chinese for ""band stand"" (亭) or ""listening"" (聽) and White used it as the name for the band. The Ting Tings started by playing for private parties at the Islington Mill arts centre in Salford, and their debut album We Started Nothing was released on 19 May 2008. Their follow-up album Sounds from Nowheresville was released on 27 February 2012 in the UK and 15 March in the United States. In 2014, White told the Daily Record that comments by Internet trolls previously caused her to stop writing songs for six months. In 2015, she sustained a tendon injury to her left hand that caused the band to cancel its U.S. tour.","The Ting Tings released their debut album We Started Nothing on 19 May 2008. Their follow-up album Sounds from Nowheresville was released on 27 February 2012 in the UK and 15 March in the United States. Super Critical, their third album, was released on 27 October 2014.",N/A,an English musician and member of the pop duo The Ting Tings,1983,1998–present,"Dance-punk, dance-pop, new rave, pop",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_White
Laura White,"White has been singing and playing the piano since she was a young girl. Despite never having had a professional singing lesson, White began singing in jazz bars at the age of 15 and played many festivals. White went to Fred Longworth High School in Tyldesley, the same school as actors Anthony Quinlan, Leah Hackett and Oliver Lee. She also studied A-Level /EnglishDrama at Wigan and Leigh College. Before The X Factor, she was a creative writing student at The University of Bolton.","White auditioned for the 2008 series of The X Factor and reached the final live stages in the ""Girls"" category, mentored by Cheryl Cole. After performing Fallin', by Alicia Keys, on the first live show, White sang You Are Not Alone as part of Michael Jackson week the following episode. She then performed God Bless the Child, originally recorded by Billie Holiday, as part of the third week's focus on big band music, and Somebody Else's Guy, written and performed by Jocelyn Brown, on the fourth live show as part of disco week. After performing Endless Love by Lionel Richie and Diana Ross in the fifth week, White was voted off the show on 8 November, after a sing-off against Ruth Lorenzo.

After her elimination, fans of White circulated a petition for broadcasting watchdog Ofcom to investigate phone voting procedures on the show, complaining of a lack of transparency in the voting system and of difficulties in getting through to vote for White–allegations which were denied by a show spokesman. The issue was even mentioned in the Houses of Parliament by her local MP Andy Burnham, who commented that White's exit had been ""very harsh"".The Manchester Evening News reported on 11 November 2008 that White had been approached by an as-yet unnamed record company. White was chosen by Peterborough City Council to perform and turn on the annual Christmas lights at Cathedral Square, Peterborough. A crowd of 6,000 attended and cheered as the lights were turned on. White then went on to switch on the lights in the county capital Cambridge on the Sunday night. White was invited to the Brit Awards Launch Party as The X Factor contestant representing the ""Hero"" single. White was a judge in the 2009 Miss Manchester contest and sang at the Miss England contest. In early August 2009, White posted samples of four tracks onto her website. Fans were allowed to vote for one of the four to become her debut single. The candidates were: ""You Should Have Known"", ""Touch You"", ""Got It Bad"" and ""Love Hurts"". ""You Should Have Known"" was chosen as her debut single. The song was written by Ivor Novello-winning songwriter Michelle Escoffrey and produced by Ian Green, the man behind Madonna's autumn 2009 album Celebration. Speaking in October 2009 to noted UK R&B writer Pete Lewis of the award-winning Blues & Soul, White stated: ""I'm really pleased to kick my whole album project off with 'You Should Have Known.""

She performed her track ""You Should Have Known"" on GMTV on 19 August 2009. The video for the single ""You Should Have Known"" was shot in early September and was uploaded to White's official YouTube account. The single was released on 2 November 2009. To promote the single, White embarked on a promo tour of the UK. ""You Should Have Known"" debuted and peaked at No. 32 on the UK Singles Chart.

Kim Wilde,"The eldest child of 1950s rock 'n' roller Marty Wilde (birth name Reginald Smith) and Joyce Baker, who had been a member of the singing and dancing group the Vernons Girls, Kim Smith was born in the West London suburb of Chiswick and attended Oakfield Preparatory School, in the Southeast London area of Dulwich. When she was nine, the family moved to Hertfordshire, where she was educated at Tewin and later Presdales School. In 1980, at age 20, she completed a foundation course at St Albans College of Art & Design. As Kim Wilde, she was signed to RAK Records by Mickie Most.","Wilde's father Marty and brother, Ricky, were responsible for writing virtually all of her material in the early-to-mid 1980s. Key influences on the songwriting process included Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), Ultravox, John Foxx, Gary Numan, Skids, Sex Pistols, the Clash, Kraftwerk and the Stranglers. Wilde released her debut single ""Kids in America"" in January 1981. An instant success, it reached number two in the UK Singles Chart and scaled the Top 5 in other countries such as Germany, France and Australia. Although it achieved only moderate success in the US, peaking at number 25 when released in 1982, it is often regarded today as Wilde's signature song. Her debut album Kim Wilde repeated the success of the single, spawning two further hits in ""Chequered Love"" (Top 5 in the UK, France, Australia and Germany) and the UK-only single ""Water on Glass"" (UK number 11).

Wilde's follow-up album was 1982's Select, led by the hit singles ""Cambodia"" and ""View from a Bridge"". Both were number 1 hits in France and reached Top 10 positions in Germany and Australia. At the time, there was some controversy about Wilde's hesitation to do live concerts. Her first concerts in September 1982 took place in Denmark, before embarking on a UK-wide tour in October. Wilde's third album, Catch as Catch Can (1983) was a relative failure. The first single from the album, ""Love Blonde"", was another success in France and Scandinavia, but failed to have major success in other countries. The failure of the album led to her leaving RAK and signing with MCA Records in the summer of 1984.Wilde's first MCA album Teases & Dares was again overlooked in her home country, but fared better in Germany, France and Scandinavia as well as scoring another German Top 10 single with ""The Second Time"" (which was Top 30 in the UK). The video for this song appeared in an episode of the 1980s TV hit Knight Rider in 1985. The second single, ""The Touch"", was not a commercial success, but the third single, the rockabilly ""Rage to Love"", made the UK top 20 in 1985. On Teases & Dares, Wilde made her first songwriting contributions, penning two songs. Meanwhile, she had embarked on three European concert tours (1983, 1985 and 1986).

On her fifth album, 1986's Another Step, Wilde wrote or co-wrote most of the songs. The album's lead single ""Schoolgirl"" flopped in Europe and Australia, but Wilde's fortunes improved in spectacular fashion with the album's second single, a Hi-NRG remake of The Supremes classic ""You Keep Me Hangin' On"". After topping the charts in Australia and Canada and peaking at number two in the UK, it became a US number one single in 1987. With that hit, she became the fifth UK female solo artist ever to top the US Hot 100, following Petula Clark, Lulu, Sheena Easton, and Bonnie Tyler. Her popularity, especially in her native UK, was revitalised and she scored further Top 10 hits in 1987 with ""Another Step (Closer to You)"" (recorded with Junior) and ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree"" (a Comic Relief charity single, recorded with comedian Mel Smith).

In 1988, Wilde released her biggest selling album to date, Close, which returned her to the UK top 10 and spent almost eight months on the UK album chart. It produced four major European hits: ""Hey Mister Heartache"", ""You Came"", ""Never Trust a Stranger"" and ""Four Letter Word"" (the last 3 were Top 10 hits in the UK). The release of the album coincided with a tour of Europe, where she was the opening act for Michael Jackson's Bad World Tour. Wilde released her next album, Love Moves, in 1990. The album barely made the UK Top 40, and, although it was a Top 10 success in Scandinavian countries, it failed to sell as well as its predecessor and only spawned two minor hits, ""It's Here"" a Top 20 success in Middle and Northern Europe as well as ""Can't Get Enough (Of Your Love)"", her last Top 20 hit in France. She toured Europe again, this time opening for fellow Briton David Bowie.

A collaboration with Rick Nowels, who had produced hits for Stevie Nicks and Belinda Carlisle, resulted in the guitar-driven pop of the single ""Love Is Holy"" and the album Love Is (1992). The album's success was again limited to a small number of countries, though the single became another Top 20 hit in the UK, and the second single (""Heart Over Mind"") also made the top 40. In 1993, she released her first official compilation album The Singles Collection 1981–1993, which was a success throughout Europe and Australia and the dancefloor-influenced single ""If I Can't Have You"" (a cover of the Yvonne Elliman song from the film Saturday Night Fever that was penned by the Bee Gees), became her last UK Top 20 Hit as well as a number 3 hit in Australia.

Wilde embarked on a huge ""Greatest Hits"" concert tour through Europe in 1994 and also toured Australia and Japan for the first time in six years. Her next album, Now & Forever (1995), was a commercial failure worldwide. Her single ""Breakin' Away"", however, was a minor hit, and the follow-up, ""This I Swear"", was also a minor hit in Europe. She released a single ""Shame"" in 1996. From February 1996 to February 1997, Wilde appeared in London's West End production of the musical, Tommy. After this, Wilde started recording a new album. However, there were problems with her record company – MCA Records had by that time become part of Universal Music – and legal problems concerning the songs. Subsequently, Wilde abandoned the album which remains unreleased.

Since November 2001, Wilde has toured the UK three times (and once in Australia during 2003) as part of the Here and Now Tour, an Eighties revival concert series, together with artists such as Paul Young, The Human League, Belinda Carlisle, Howard Jones and Five Star. New recordings also followed; in 2001, she recorded a new track, ""Loved"", for a compilation album which became a surprise hit in Belgium. She recorded the single ""Born to be Wild"" in 2002, and in summer of 2003 she had a major hit with ""Anyplace, Anywhere, Anytime"", a duet with German pop star Nena. The single was a Top 10 hit in Germany, Belgium, Austria, Netherlands and Switzerland.

In 2006, Wilde signed a new record deal with EMI Germany and released the first single from her tenth studio album in many countries across Europe, Scandinavia and Asia. ""You Came 2006"" charted Top 20 in most of these countries and became her biggest solo hit in Germany since 1988. The album Never Say Never included eight new tracks plus five re-worked previous hits and has charted in Belgium, France, Switzerland, Austria and Germany. The second single from the album, which was voted for by fans on her official website was ""Perfect Girl"", released in November 2006 and spent nine weeks on the German Top 100 singles chart. A third single, ""Together We Belong"", was released in March 2007 and a fourth single, ""Baby Obey Me"", was released in Germany as a remix featuring German rapper Ill Inspecta.

Since 2003, Wilde has appeared on numerous festival bills and concerts all over Europe with her own band. In early September 2009, a brand new single, ""Run to You"", recorded as a duet with Swedish rock band Fibes, Oh Fibes!, was released in Sweden. The song reached the Swedish Top 30.

In 2010, Wilde signed a new record deal with Sony Music Germany. The label released her eleventh studio album, Come Out and Play on 17 August, with ""Lights Down Low"" preceding that as lead single. The album reached number 10 in Germany and was followed by a tour in Europe in February and March 2011.

Wilde's twelfth studio album, Snapshots, was released on 26 August 2011 and features cover versions of songs hand-picked from the last five decades. A double release of ""It's Alright"" and ""Sleeping Satellite"" was released on 19 August as the lead single. Two further singles failed to reach the chart. Kim toured in support of the album in Germany in March 2012. In November 2012, Wilde was featured as the lead vocalist on Reflekt's ""A Beautiful House,"" which can be found on Armada Music's ""Antillas & Dankmann's Best Remix 2002–2012"" compilation.

Wilde released her next studio album, Wilde Winter Songbook in November 2013. On 18 December 2017, Wilde released a Christmas single with Lawnmower Deth titled ""F U Kristmas!"". Wilde released her 14th studio album Here Come the Aliens on 16 March 2018. It was inspired by an encounter with a UFO she had in 2009. While sitting in her garden with her husband and a friend, they noticed something odd about the sky and experienced an eerie silence. They observed a huge bright light behind a cloud. Being curious she walked down the grass to track the source of the light and what she noticed was that the light was swiftly moving back and forth. She thought about it every day and it gave her the idea for her new album.

On 25 June 2019 The New York Times Magazine listed Kim Wilde among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

In May 2021, Wilde confirmed she would celebrate 40 years of music with the release of a box-set greatest hits album titled, Pop Don't Stop. The album is scheduled for released in August 2021.","

Jade Williams,N/A,"Prior to her renderings of songs for the supermarket chain Aldi, Williams released her debut single as Sunday Girl, ""Four Floors"", through Polydor Records on 28 March 2010. A music video directed by Elisha Smith-Leverock was also released to accompany the release of the single. On 15 July 2010, she released her second single, ""Self Control"", a cover of the 1984 Raf song popularized worldwide by the late Laura Branigan. A music video, again directed by Smith-Leverock, was released to accompany the single release.

She supported Ellie Goulding on tour during November 2010, and played her first headlining show at London's XOYO on 15 December 2010. Her third single, ""Stop Hey,"" was officially released through iTunes by Polydor in February 2011. She wrote and produced the song (along many others from her yet-to-be-released album) with Jim Eliot, who has also worked with Kylie Minogue, Ladyhawke, and Ellie Goulding. A music video for ""Stop Hey"" was directed by Smith-Leverock, and themes for the video came from superstitions about bad luck. In June 2011, Williams was featured on Martin Solveig's album Smash, performing ""Let's Not Play Games,"" which she co-wrote. Her cover of ""Love U More"", originally by Sunscreem, was promotionally released along with its accompanying video in October 2011, but its commercial release was delayed indefinitely. That November, she also went on tour to support LMFAO on a few of their UK dates. Williams then recorded a cover of Pixies' ""Where Is My Mind?"" for Thomson's 2011 holiday TV campaign, and the single's success helped her to be signed by Universal's Island Records in early 2012.

Williams became one-half of DJ duo Ooh La La! in February 2012 with model Zara Martin. The pair have since streamed mixes 90s Hip Hop, R&B and Pop at night clubs and fashion parties in London and other cities in the UK. In March 2012, she co-wrote a song titled ""Turn Up the Radio"" for Madonna's twelfth studio album MDNA. Furthermore, she released ""High & Low"" from the official motion picture soundtrack of StreetDance 2. In February 2013, Williams announced the end of the Sunday Girl project, and released her first single and music video under the moniker of Whinnie Williams, ""You Don't Love Me"", in early 2013, later followed by ""Break Hearts in Your Sleep"". Both of these singles were released free via Williams' SoundCloud page, as was her first mixtape, Mix Tape Vol 1, released in December 2013.Fashion has been a huge part of Jade Williams' career alongside her passion for music. Her first role as a model came in October 2010 when she became the new face of River Island's Design Forum campaign. She has a fashion blog/vlog on MSN Life & Style, puts together all of her tour outfits and stage design, and even put out her own fashion line with Firetrap in September 2011. Williams cites her fashion icons as Coco Chanel and Karl Lagerfeld, and describes her own style to be masculine, tailored, and tom-boyish.

In 2011, a portrait of Williams was painted by British artist Joe Simpson, the painting was exhibited around the UK including a solo exhibition at The Royal Albert Hall.","Bad Girl—* Released: 6 October 2014 * Format: 12"", digital download * Label: Night Beach,Mix Tape Vol 1—* Released: 24 December 2013 * Format: Digital download * Label: Independent,Mix Tape Vol 2—* Released: 20 June 2014 * Format: Digital download * Label: Independent,""Not Alone"" (DHP featuring Sunday Girl)—2012,""Not Alone"" (DHP featuring Sunday Girl)—2012,""Love U More""—2011—N/A,""You Don't Love Me""—2013—Bad Girl,a Released under the Sunday Girl moniker.""Let's Not Play Games"" (Martin Solveig featuring Sunday Girl)—2011—Smash,",N/A,"a British independent pop singer, interior designer & presenter",1988,2009–present,"Indie pop, alternative pop",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Williams

Amanda Wilson,"Wilson provided lead vocals on the track ""When We Were in Love"", which made it to the semi-final of The Great British Song Contest 1998 to select the UK's entry for the Eurovision Song Contest.

She has a four octave vocal range and her vocals have been compared to Mariah Carey. Her vocal skills brought her to the attention of music industry A&R. However most of Wilson's success has been found as a guest vocalist working with dance acts.Wilson provided lead vocals on many tracks on the Freemasons' album, Shakedown. She was first discovered by a couple of producers who pitched a song with her voice to The Freemasons; they didn't feel the track but loved the singer and that was the breakthrough. Her biggest hit was the Freemasons track, ""Love on My Mind"", which reached number 11 in 2005 on the UK Singles Chart. The song sampled vocals from ""This Time Baby"" by Jackie Moore, and lyrics from ""When The Heartache Is Over"" by Tina Turner. Wilson's vocals on the track were electronically lowered in pitch to blend in with the sampled vocals of Jackie Moore.

Following her success with the Freemasons' first album, Wilson went on to provide lead vocals for their 2008 remix of Gusto's ""Disco's Revenge"", which gave her a third Top 40 hit in the UK (peaking at number 34).

Although she was credited for the track: ""Avicii vs. David Guetta & Afrojack ft. Amanda Wilson - I Could Say Goodbye "". She did not provide the vocals or have any involvement in the track, or naming of the song.",N/A,"

Amy Winehouse,"Amy Jade Winehouse was born on 14 September 1983 at Chase Farm Hospital in Gordon Hill, Enfield, to Jewish parents. Her father, Mitchell ""Mitch"" Winehouse, was a window panel installer and taxi driver; her mother, Janis Winehouse (née Seaton), was a pharmacist, who suffers from multiple sclerosis. Winehouse's ancestors were Russian Jewish and Polish Jewish immigrants to London. She had an older brother, Alex (born 1979), and the family lived in London's Southgate area, where she attended Osidge Primary School. Winehouse attended a Jewish Sunday school while she was a child. During an interview following her rise to fame, she expressed her dismissal towards the school by saying that she used to beg her father to permit her not to go and that she learned nothing about being Jewish by going anyway. In the same interview, Winehouse said she only went to a synagogue once a year on Yom Kippur ""out of respect"".

Many of Winehouse's maternal uncles were professional jazz musicians. Amy's paternal grandmother, Cynthia, was a singer and dated the English jazz saxophonist Ronnie Scott. She and Amy's parents influenced Amy's interest in jazz. Her father, Mitch, often sang Frank Sinatra songs to her, and whenever she got chastised at school, she would sing ""Fly Me to the Moon"" before going up to the headmistress to be told off. Winehouse's parents separated when she was nine, and she lived with her mother and stayed with her father and his girlfriend in Hatfield Heath, Essex, on weekends.

In 1992, her grandmother Cynthia suggested that Amy attend the Susi Earnshaw Theatre School, where she went on Saturdays to further her vocal education and to learn to tap dance. She attended the school for four years and founded a short-lived rap group called Sweet 'n' Sour, with Juliette Ashby, her childhood friend, before seeking full-time training at Sylvia Young Theatre School. Several years later it was reported that Winehouse had been expelled at 14 for ""not applying herself"" and also for piercing her nose, but these claims were denied by Sylvia Young: ""She changed schools at 15...I've heard it said she was expelled; she wasn't. I'd never have expelled Amy."" Mitch Winehouse also denied the claims. She attended the Mount School, Mill Hill and the BRIT School in Selhurst, Croydon, dropping out at age 16.

After toying around with her brother Alex's guitar, Winehouse bought her own when she was 14 and began writing music shortly afterwards. Soon after she began working for a living, as an entertainment journalist for the World Entertainment News Network and also singing with local group the Bolsha Band. In July 2000, she became the featured female vocalist with the National Youth Jazz Orchestra. She was influenced by Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington, the latter of whom she was already listening to at home. Winehouse's best friend, soul singer Tyler James, sent her demo tape to an A&R person.","Winehouse signed to Simon Fuller's 19 Management in 2002 and was paid £250 a week against future earnings. While being developed by the management company, Winehouse was kept as a recording industry secret, although she was a regular jazz standards singer at the Cobden Club. Her future A&R representative at Island, Darcus Beese, heard of her by accident when the manager of The Lewinson Brothers showed him some productions of his clients, which featured Winehouse as key vocalist. When he asked who the singer was, the manager told him he was not allowed to say. Having decided that he wanted to sign her, it took several months of asking around for Beese to eventually discover who the singer was. However, Winehouse had already recorded a number of songs and signed a publishing deal with EMI by this time. Incidentally, she formed a working relationship with producer Salaam Remi through these record publishers.

Beese introduced Winehouse to his boss, Nick Gatfield; the Island head shared his enthusiasm in signing the young artist. Winehouse was signed to Island, as rival interest in her had started to build with representatives of EMI and Virgin starting to make moves. Beese told HitQuarters that he felt the excitement over an artist who was an atypical pop star for the time was due to a backlash against reality TV music shows, which included audiences starved for fresh, genuine young talent.

Winehouse's debut album, Frank, was released on 20 October 2003. Produced mainly by Salaam Remi, many songs were influenced by jazz and, apart from two covers, Winehouse co-wrote every song. The album received critical acclaim with compliments given to the ""cool, critical gaze"" in its lyrics. Winehouse's voice was compared with those of Sarah Vaughan and Macy Gray, among others.

The album entered the upper reaches of the UK album chart in 2004 when it was nominated for the Brit Awards in the categories of ""British Female Solo Artist"" and ""British Urban Act."" It went on to achieve platinum sales. Later in 2004, she and Remi won the Ivor Novello Award for Best Contemporary Song, for their first single together, ""Stronger Than Me."" The album was also shortlisted for the 2004 Mercury Music Prize. In the same year, she performed at the Glastonbury Festival – Jazzworld, the V Festival and the Montreal International Jazz Festival. After the release of the album, Winehouse commented that she was ""only 80 percent behind [the] album"" because Island Records had overruled her preferences for the songs and mixes to be included. The further singles from the album were ""Take the Box,"" ""In My Bed""/""You Sent Me Flying"" and ""Pumps""/""Help Yourself.""After the release of her first jazz-influenced album, Winehouse's focus shifted to the girl groups of the 1950s and 1960s. Winehouse hired New York singer Sharon Jones's longtime band, the Dap-Kings, to back her up in the studio and on tour. Mitch Winehouse relates in Amy, My Daughter how fascinating watching her process was: her perfectionism in the studio and how she would put what she had sung on a CD and play it in his taxi outside to know how most people would hear her music. In May 2006, Winehouse's demo tracks such as ""You Know I'm No Good"" and ""Rehab"" appeared on Mark Ronson's New York radio show on East Village Radio. These were some of the first new songs played on the radio after the release of ""Pumps"" and both were slated to appear on her second album. The 11-track album, completed in five months, was produced entirely by Salaam Remi and Ronson, with the production credits being split between them. Ronson said in a 2010 interview that he liked working with Winehouse because she was blunt when she did not like his work. She in turn thought that when they first met, he was a sound engineer and that she was expecting an older man with a beard.

Promotion of Back to Black soon began and, in early October 2006 Winehouse's official website was relaunched with a new layout and clips of previously unreleased songs. Back to Black was released in the UK on 30 October 2006. It went to number one on the UK Albums Chart for two weeks in January 2007, dropping then climbing back for several weeks in February. In the US, it entered at number seven on the Billboard 200. It was the best-selling album in the UK of 2007, selling 1.85million copies over the course of the year. The first single released from the album was the Ronson-produced ""Rehab."" The song reached the top ten in the UK and the US. Time magazine named ""Rehab"" the Best Song of 2007. Writer Josh Tyrangiel praised Winehouse for her confidence, saying, ""What she is is mouthy, funny, sultry, and quite possibly crazy"" and ""It's impossible not to be seduced by her originality. Combine it with production by Mark Ronson that references four decades worth of soul music without once ripping it off, and you've got the best song of 2007."" The album's second single and lead single in the US, ""You Know I'm No Good,"" was released in January 2007 with a remix featuring rap vocals by Ghostface Killah. It ultimately reached number 18 on the UK singles chart. The title track, ""Back to Black,"" was released in the UK in April 2007 and peaked at number 25, but was more successful across mainland Europe. ""Tears Dry on Their Own,"" ""Love Is a Losing Game"" were also released as singles, but failed to achieve the same level of success.

A deluxe edition of Back to Black was also released on 5 November 2007 in the UK. The bonus disc features B-sides, rare, and live tracks, as well as ""Valerie."" Winehouse's debut DVD I Told You I Was Trouble: Live in London was released the same day in the UK and 13 November in the US. It includes a live set recorded at London's Shepherd's Bush Empire and a 50-minute documentary charting the singer's career over the previous four years. Frank was released in the United States on 20 November 2007 to positive reviews. The album debuted at number 61 on the Billboard 200 chart. In addition to her own album, she collaborated with other artists on singles. Winehouse was a vocalist on the song ""Valerie"" on Ronson's solo album Version. The song peaked at number two in the UK, upon its October single release. ""Valerie"" was nominated for a 2008 Brit Award for ""Best British Single."" Her work with ex-Sugababe Mutya Buena, ""B Boy Baby,"" was released on 17 December 2007. It served as the fourth single from Buena's debut album, Real Girl. Winehouse was also in talks of working with Missy Elliott for her album Block Party.

Winehouse promoted the release of Back to Black with headline performances in late 2006, including a Little Noise Sessions charity concert at the Union Chapel in Islington, London. On 31 December 2006, Winehouse appeared on Jools Holland's Annual Hootenanny and performed a cover of Marvin Gaye's ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine"" along with Paul Weller and Holland's Rhythm and Blues Orchestra. She also performed Toots and the Maytals' ""Monkey Man"". At his request, actor Bruce Willis introduced Winehouse before her performance of ""Rehab"" at the 2007 MTV Movie Awards in Universal City, California, on 3 June 2007. During the summer of 2007, she performed at various festivals, including Glastonbury Festival and Lollapalooza in Chicago.

The rest of her tour, however, did not go as well. In November 2007, the opening night of a 17-date tour was marred by booing and walkouts at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham. A critic for the Birmingham Mail said it was ""one of the saddest nights of my life...I saw a supremely talented artist reduced to tears, stumbling around the stage and, unforgivably, swearing at the audience."" Other concerts ended similarly, with, for example, fans at her Hammersmith Apollo performance in London saying that she ""looked highly intoxicated throughout,"" until she announced on 27 November 2007, that her performances and public appearances were cancelled for the remainder of the year, citing her doctor's advice to take a complete rest. A statement issued by concert promoter Live Nation blamed ""the rigours involved in touring and the intense emotional strain that Amy has been under in recent weeks"" for the decision. Mitch Winehouse wrote about her nervousness before public performances in his 2012 book, Amy, My Daughter. On 13 January 2008, Back to Black held the number-one position on the Billboard Pan European charts for the third consecutive week.



On 10 February 2008, Winehouse received five Grammy Awards, winning in the following categories: Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for the single ""Rehab,"" and Best Pop Vocal Album. The singer also earned a Grammy as Best New Artist, earning her an entry in the 2009 edition of the Guinness Book of Records for Most Grammy Awards won by a British Female Act. Additionally, Back to Black was nominated for Album of the Year. Ronson's work with her won the Grammy Award for Producer of the Year, in the non-classical category. She ended her acceptance speech for Record of the Year with, ""This is for London because Camden town ain't burning down,"" in reference to the 2008 Camden Market fire. Performing ""You Know I'm No Good"" and ""Rehab"" via satellite from London's Riverside Studios at 3 a.m. UK time, she couldn't be at the ceremony in Los Angeles as her visa approval had not been processed in time.

After the Grammys, the album's sales increased, catapulting Back to Black to number two on the US Billboard 200, after it initially peaked in the seventh position. On 20 February 2008, Winehouse performed at the 2008 Brit Awards at Earls Court in London, performing ""Valerie"" with Mark Ronson, followed by ""Love Is a Losing Game."" She urged the crowd to ""make some noise for my Blake."" A special deluxe edition of Back to Black topped the UK album charts on 2 March 2008. Meanwhile, the original edition of the album was ranked at number 30 in its 68th week on the charts, while Frank charted at number 35.

In Paris, she performed what was described as a ""well-executed 40-minute"" set at the opening of a Fendi boutique in early March. By 12 March, the album had sold a total of 2,467,575 copies—318,350 copies had been sold in the previous 10 weeks—putting the album on the UK's top-10 best-selling albums of the 21st century for the first time. On 7 April, Back to Black was in the top position of the pan-European charts for the sixth consecutive and thirteenth aggregate week. Amy Winehouse – The Girl Done Good: A Documentary Review, a 78-minute DVD, was released on 14 April 2008. The documentary features interviews with those who knew her at a young age, people who helped her achieve success, jazz music experts, and music and pop-culture specialists.

At the 2008 Ivor Novello Awards in May, Winehouse became the first-ever artist to receive two nominations for the top award: Best Song Musically & Lyrically. She won the award for ""Love Is a Losing Game"" and was nominated for ""You Know I'm No Good."" ""Rehab,"" a Novello winner for best contemporary song in 2006, also received a 2008 nomination for best-selling British song. Winehouse was also nominated for a 2008 MTV Europe Award in the ""Act of the Year"" category.

Although her father, manager and various members of her touring team reportedly tried to dissuade her, Winehouse performed at the Rock in Rio Lisboa festival in Portugal in May 2008. Although the set was plagued by a late arrival and problems with her voice, the crowd warmed to her. In addition to her own material she performed two Specials covers. Winehouse performed at Nelson Mandela's 90th Birthday Party concert at London's Hyde Park on 27 June 2008, and the next day at the Glastonbury Festival. On 12 July, at the Oxegen Festival in Ireland she performed a well-received 50-minute set which was followed the next day by a 14-song set at T in the Park.

On 16 August she played at the Staffordshire leg of the V Festival, and the following day played the Chelmsford leg of the festival. Organisers said that Winehouse attracted the biggest crowds of the festival. Audience reaction was reported as mixed. On 6 September, she was Bestival's Saturday headliner, where her performance was described as polished—terminated by a curfew as the show running overdue, after Winehouse started an hour late—and her storming off stage.

A clip of Winehouse's music was included in the ""Roots and Influences"" area that looked at connections between different artists at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Annex NYC, which opened in December 2008. One thread started with Billie Holiday, continued with Aretha Franklin and Mary J. Blige, and then finished with Winehouse.

Back to Black was the world's seventh-biggest-selling album of 2008. The album's sales meant that the market performance of Universal Music's recorded music division did not drop to levels experienced by the overall music market.In a 2009 poll of U.S. residents conducted for VisitBritain by Harris Interactive, one-fifth of the participants indicated they had listened to Winehouse's music during the previous year. She performed with Rhythms del Mundo on their cover of the Sam Cooke song, ""Cupid"", for an Artists Project Earth benefit album released in July that year.

Winehouse and Ronson contributed a cover of Lesley Gore's ""It's My Party"" to the Quincy Jones tribute album Q Soul Bossa Nostra, released in November 2010. She had agreed to form a group with Questlove of the Roots but her problems obtaining a visa delayed their working together. Salaam Remi had already created some material with Winehouse as part of the project. According to The Times, Universal Music pressed her for new material in 2008, but as of 2 September that year she had not been near a recording studio. In late October, Winehouse's spokesman was quoted as saying that Winehouse had not been given a deadline to complete her third album, for which she was learning to play drums.

In May 2009, Winehouse returned to performing at a jazz festival in St. Lucia amid torrential downpours and technical difficulties. During her set, it was reported she was unsteady on her feet and had trouble remembering lyrics. She apologised to the crowd for being ""bored"" and ended the set in the middle of a song. During her stay in St. Lucia, however, she worked on new music with Remi. On 23 August that year Winehouse sang with the Specials at the V Festival, on their songs ""You're Wondering Now"" and ""Ghost Town"".

Island claimed that a new album would be due for release in 2010. Island co-president Darcus Beese said, ""I've heard a couple of song demos that have absolutely floored me."" In July 2010, Winehouse was quoted as saying her next album would be released no later than January 2011, saying ""It's going to be very much the same as my second album, where there's a lot of jukebox stuff and songs that are... just jukebox, really."" Ronson, however, said at that time that he had not started to record the album. She performed ""Valerie"" with Ronson at a movie premiere but forgot some of the song's lyrics. In October, Winehouse performed a four-song set to promote her fashion line. In December 2010, she played a 40-minute concert at a Russian oligarch's party in Moscow, with the tycoon hand-selecting the songs.

In January 2011, Winehouse played five dates in Brazil, with opening acts of Janelle Monáe and Mayer Hawthorne. The following month she cut short a performance in Dubai following booing from the audience. Winehouse was reported to be tired, distracted and ""tipsy"" during the performance.

On 18 June 2011, Winehouse started her twelve-leg European tour in Belgrade. Local media described her performance as a scandal and disaster; she was booed off the stage due to her apparently being too drunk to perform. Serbian defence minister Dragan Sutanovac called Winehouse's performances ""a huge shame and a disappointment"". It was reported that she was unable to remember the city she was in, the lyrics of her songs or the names of the members of her band. The local press also claimed that Winehouse was forced to perform by her bodyguards, who did not allow her to leave the stage when she tried to do so. She then pulled out of performances in Istanbul and Athens, which had been scheduled for the following week. On 21 June, it was announced that she had cancelled all shows of her tour and would be given ""as long as it takes"" to sort herself out.

Winehouse's last public appearance took place at Camden's Roundhouse on 20 July 2011, when she made a surprise appearance on stage to support her goddaughter, Dionne Bromfield, who was singing ""Mama Said"" with the Wanted. Winehouse died three days later. Her last recording was a duet with American singer Tony Bennett for his album, Duets II, released on 20 September 2011. Their single from the album, ""Body and Soul"", was released on 14 September 2011 on MTV and VH1 to commemorate what would have been her 28th birthday.","

Norma Winstone,"Born as Norma Ann Short in Bow, East London, England, she was 10 years old when her family moved to Dagenham, Essex. Encouraged by her primary school teacher, she applied for and won a scholarship to attend Saturday-school at Trinity Music College, and after passing her 11-plus exams, she went to Dagenham County High School (where Dudley Moore was then a senior pupil). Like Moore, her music teacher there was Peter Cork (1926-2012). At the age of 17 she discovered jazz, listening to Ella Fitzgerald and Oscar Peterson being played on Radio Luxembourg.Winstone began singing in bands around Dagenham in the early 1960s, and has said of her early experiences: ""I've always been on the edge, always felt like I was swimming against the tide and somehow couldn't stop. I met a pianist called Chris Goody and we'd get together and play things. He knew Margaret Busby who was in a publishing company called Alison and Busby. She also wrote lyrics for tunes like 'Naima'. I was inspired by her, though I didn't write words myself at that time, I didn't think I could."" Winstone first attracted attention when in the late 1960s she appeared at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club sharing the bill with Roland Kirk. Interviewed in 2020, she said: ""I went along to a gig at the Charlie Chester Club and I sat in with a drummer called John Stevens and he was incredibly enthusiastic and jumped up and said, 'I'm going to tell Ronnie Scott about you, he should give you an audition!' ... Eventually, I went to the club, and after reminding Ronnie that eight months before he promised to invite me for an audition, we got it and he gave me four weeks there opposite Roland Kirk. I think I was on cloud nine...."" This led to her first radio BBC broadcast, which by chance was heard by singer Carmen McRae on a visit from the US, who met Winstone and was interviewed for a jazz magazine with her.

Winstone joined Michael Garrick's band in 1968. Her first recording came the following year, with Joe Harriott and Amancio D'Silva, on Hum-Dono (reissued in 2015). In 1971 she was voted top singer in the Melody Maker Jazz Poll. She recorded the album Edge of Time under her own name in 1972. Winstone contributed vocals to Ian Carr's Nucleus on that band's 1973 release Labyrinth, a jazz-rock concept album based on the Greek myth about the Minotaur.

Winstone has worked with many major European musicians and visiting Americans, as well as with most of her peers in British jazz, including Garrick, John Surman, Michael Gibbs, Mike Westbrook and her former husband, the pianist John Taylor. With Taylor and trumpeter Kenny Wheeler she performed and recorded three albums for ECM as a member of the trio Azimuth between 1977 and 1980; their fifth and last album How It Was Then… Never Again (1995) was given four stars by DownBeat magazine.

Her own 1987 album Somewhere Called Home, also released on the ECM label, has often been called ""a classic"". The review by AllMusic said: ""It's not only a watermark of Winstone's career but, in the long line of modern vocal outings released since the romantic vocal tradition of Fitzgerald and Vaughan ended with free jazz and fusion, the disc stands out as one most original yet idyllic of vocal jazz recordings. ... A must for fans looking for something as cozy as a golden age chanteuse, but without all the gymnastic scatting and carbon copy ways of many a contemporary jazz singer."" In addition, she made albums with the American pianists Jimmy Rowles – Well Kept Secret, recorded in 1993 – and Fred Hersch. On Well Kept Secret Winstone sang lyrics she had written to Rowles' composition ""The Peacocks"", which she had heard on the Bill Evans album You Must Believe in Spring (1981). With the title ""A Timeless Place"", Winstone's lyrics were subsequently recorded by others, including Mark Murphy. Well respected as a lyricist, she has also written words to tunes by Ralph Towner, Egberto Gismonti, Ivan Lins, Steve Swallow, and other musicians.

In 2001, Winstone was honoured as ""Best Vocalist"" in the BBC Jazz Awards, also being nominated in 2007 and 2008.

In February 2018, Winstone released Descansado: Songs for Films, a collection that AllMusic described as ""an unusual and provocative album"".","Winstone began singing in bands around Dagenham in the early 1960s, and has said of her early experiences: ""I've always been on the edge, always felt like I was swimming against the tide and somehow couldn't stop.

I think I was on cloud nine...."" This led to her first radio BBC broadcast, which by chance was heard by singer Carmen McRae on a visit from the US, who met Winstone and was interviewed for a jazz magazine with her.

Winstone joined Michael Garrick's band in 1968. Her first recording came the following year, with Joe Harriott and Amancio D'Silva, on Hum-Dono (reissued in 2015). In 1971 she was voted top singer in the Melody Maker Jazz Poll. She recorded the album Edge of Time under her own name in 1972. Winstone contributed vocals to Ian Carr's Nucleus on that band's 1973 release Labyrinth, a jazz-rock concept album based on the Greek myth about the Minotaur.

Winstone has worked with many major European musicians and visiting Americans, as well as with most of her peers in British jazz, including Garrick, John Surman, Michael Gibbs, Mike Westbrook and her former husband, the pianist John Taylor. With Taylor and trumpeter Kenny Wheeler she performed and recorded three albums for ECM as a member of the trio Azimuth between 1977 and 1980; their fifth and last album How It Was Then… Never Again (1995) was given four stars by DownBeat magazine.

Her own 1987 album Somewhere Called Home, also released on the ECM label, has often been called ""a classic"". The review by AllMusic said: ""It's not only a watermark of Winstone's career but, in the long line of modern vocal outings released since the romantic vocal tradition of Fitzgerald and Vaughan ended with free jazz and fusion, the disc stands out as one most original yet idyllic of vocal jazz recordings. ... A must for fans looking for something as cozy as a golden age chanteuse, but without all the gymnastic scatting and carbon copy ways of many a contemporary jazz singer."" In addition, she made albums with the American pianists Jimmy Rowles – Well Kept Secret, recorded in 1993 – and Fred Hersch. On Well Kept Secret Winstone sang lyrics she had written to Rowles' composition ""The Peacocks"", which she had heard on the Bill Evans album You Must Believe in Spring (1981). With the title ""A Timeless Place"", Winstone's lyrics were subsequently recorded by others, including Mark Murphy. Well respected as a lyricist, she has also written words to tunes by Ralph Towner, Egberto Gismonti, Ivan Lins, Steve Swallow, and other musicians.

In 2001, Winstone was honoured as ""Best Vocalist"" in the BBC Jazz Awards, also being nominated in 2007 and 2008.

In February 2018, Winstone released Descansado: Songs for Films, a collection that AllMusic described as ""an unusual and provocative album"".","
